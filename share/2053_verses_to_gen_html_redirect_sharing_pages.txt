1-Chronicles-16-11	Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.	1 Chronicles 16 : 11	F-161	bgc-0010
1-Chronicles-16-34	O give thanks unto the LORD; for <i>he is</i> good; for his mercy <i>endureth</i> for ever.	1 Chronicles 16 : 34	F-226	bgc-0004
1-Chronicles-16-8	Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people.	1 Chronicles 16 : 8	S-107	bgc-0007
1-Chronicles-17-11	And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go <i>to be</i> with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.	1 Chronicles 17 : 11	F-173	bgc-0010
1-Chronicles-22-13	Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.	1 Chronicles 22 : 13	F-235	bgc-0015
1-Chronicles-29-11	Thine, O LORD, <i>is</i> the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all <i>that is</i> in the heaven and in the earth <i>is thine</i>; thine <i>is</i> the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all.	1 Chronicles 29 : 11	F-090	bgc-0003
1-Chronicles-29-12	Both riches and honour <i>come</i> of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand <i>is</i> power and might; and in thine hand <i>it is</i> to make great, and to give strength unto all.	1 Chronicles 29 : 12	F-188	bgc-0004
1-Chronicles-29-13	Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.	1 Chronicles 29 : 13	S-010	bgc-0005
1-Chronicles-29-14	But who <i>am</i> I, and what <i>is</i> my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things <i>come</i> of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.	1 Chronicles 29 : 14	F-074	bgc-0006
1-Chronicles-29-15	For we <i>are</i> strangers before thee, and sojourners, as <i>were</i> all our fathers: our days on the earth <i>are</i> as a shadow, and <i>there is</i> none abiding.	1 Chronicles 29 : 15	S-025	bgc-0007
1-Chronicles-29-17	I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.	1 Chronicles 29 : 17	F-248	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-1-10	Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and <i>that</i> there be no divisions among you; but <i>that</i> ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.	1 Corinthians 1 : 10	S-005	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-1-18	For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.	1 Corinthians 1 : 18	F-208	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-1-25	Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.	1 Corinthians 1 : 25	F-168	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-1-30	But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:	1 Corinthians 1 : 30	S-122	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-1-9	God <i>is</i> faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.	1 Corinthians 1 : 9	S-049	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-10-12	Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.	1 Corinthians 10 : 12	F-340	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-10-13	There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God <i>is</i> faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear <i>it</i>.	1 Corinthians 10 : 13	S-123	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-10-24	Let no man seek his own, but every man anotherâ€™s <i>wealth</i>.	1 Corinthians 10 : 24	S-048	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-10-31	Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.	1 Corinthians 10 : 31	S-030	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-11-12	For as the woman <i>is</i> of the man, even so <i>is</i> the man also by the woman; but all things of God.	1 Corinthians 11 : 12	F-153	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-12-12	For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also <i>is</i> Christ.	1 Corinthians 12 : 12	S-040	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-12-13	For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether <i>we be</i> Jews or Gentiles, whether <i>we be</i> bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.	1 Corinthians 12 : 13	S-028	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-12-14	For the body is not one member, but many.	1 Corinthians 12 : 14	F-150	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-12-4	Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.	1 Corinthians 12 : 4	F-031	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-13-1	Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become <i>as</i> sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.	1 Corinthians 13 : 1	F-200	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-13-11	When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.	1 Corinthians 13 : 11	F-139	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-13-12	For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.	1 Corinthians 13 : 12	F-133	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-13-13	And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these <i>is</i> charity.	1 Corinthians 13 : 13	F-336	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-13-2	And though I have <i>the gift of</i> prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.	1 Corinthians 13 : 2	F-277	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-13-3	And though I bestow all my goods to feed <i>the poor</i>, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.	1 Corinthians 13 : 3	F-204	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-13-4	Charity suffereth long, <i>and</i> is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,	1 Corinthians 13 : 4	F-222	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-13-5	Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;	1 Corinthians 13 : 5	F-225	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-13-6	Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;	1 Corinthians 13 : 6	F-019	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-13-7	Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.	1 Corinthians 13 : 7	F-061	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-13-8	Charity never faileth: but whether <i>there be</i> prophecies, they shall fail; whether <i>there be</i> tongues, they shall cease; whether <i>there be</i> knowledge, it shall vanish away.	1 Corinthians 13 : 8	F-322	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-14-1	Follow after charity, and desire spiritual <i>gifts</i>, but rather that ye may prophesy.	1 Corinthians 14 : 1	S-013	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-14-33	For God is not <i>the author</i> of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.	1 Corinthians 14 : 33	S-024	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-15-1	Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;	1 Corinthians 15 : 1	F-285	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-15-2	By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.	1 Corinthians 15 : 2	F-070	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-15-3	For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;	1 Corinthians 15 : 3	F-264	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-15-34	Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak <i>this</i> to your shame.	1 Corinthians 15 : 34	F-328	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-15-4	And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:	1 Corinthians 15 : 4	S-124	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-15-45	And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam <i>was made</i> a quickening spirit.	1 Corinthians 15 : 45	F-046	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-15-50	Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.	1 Corinthians 15 : 50	F-003	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-15-51	Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,	1 Corinthians 15 : 51	F-283	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-15-55	O death, where <i>is</i> thy sting? O grave, where <i>is</i> thy victory?	1 Corinthians 15 : 55	S-108	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-15-57	But thanks <i>be</i> to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.	1 Corinthians 15 : 57	S-015	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-15-58	Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.	1 Corinthians 15 : 58	S-053	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-16-13	Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.	1 Corinthians 16 : 13	S-132	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-16-14	Let all your things be done with charity.	1 Corinthians 16 : 14	F-064	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-16-4	And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.	1 Corinthians 16 : 4	F-279	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-2-10	But God hath revealed <i>them</i> unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.	1 Corinthians 2 : 10	S-083	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-2-11	For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.	1 Corinthians 2 : 11	S-046	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-2-14	But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know <i>them</i>, because they are spiritually discerned.	1 Corinthians 2 : 14	S-076	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-2-16	For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.	1 Corinthians 2 : 16	S-098	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-2-2	For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.	1 Corinthians 2 : 2	F-166	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-2-9	But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.	1 Corinthians 2 : 9	F-151	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-3-11	For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.	1 Corinthians 3 : 11	F-030	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-3-16	Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and <i>that</i> the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?	1 Corinthians 3 : 16	S-097	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-3-18	Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.	1 Corinthians 3 : 18	F-180	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-3-3	For ye are yet carnal: for whereas <i>there is</i> among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?	1 Corinthians 3 : 3	S-037	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-3-9	For we are labourers together with God: ye are Godâ€™s husbandry, <i>ye are</i> Godâ€™s building.	1 Corinthians 3 : 9	S-043	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-4-6	And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and <i>to</i> Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think <i>of men</i> above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.	1 Corinthians 4 : 6	F-148	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-6-10	Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.	1 Corinthians 6 : 10	F-327	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-6-12	All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.	1 Corinthians 6 : 12	S-011	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-6-19	What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost <i>which is</i> in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?	1 Corinthians 6 : 19	F-298	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-6-20	For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are Godâ€™s.	1 Corinthians 6 : 20	S-076	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-6-9	Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,	1 Corinthians 6 : 9	S-007	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-7-2	Nevertheless, <i>to avoid</i> fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.	1 Corinthians 7 : 2	F-291	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-8-6	But to us <i>there is but</i> one God, the Father, of whom <i>are</i> all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom <i>are</i> all things, and we by him.	1 Corinthians 8 : 6	S-066	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-8-9	But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.	1 Corinthians 8 : 9	F-238	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-9-25	And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they <i>do it</i> to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.	1 Corinthians 9 : 25	F-271	bgc-0003
1-John-1-1	That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;	1 John 1 : 1	S-042	bgc-0003
1-John-1-2	(For the life was manifested, and we have seen <i>it</i>, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)	1 John 1 : 2	F-093	bgc-0004
1-John-1-5	This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.	1 John 1 : 5	S-051	bgc-0007
1-John-1-6	If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:	1 John 1 : 6	S-116	bgc-0008
1-John-1-7	But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.	1 John 1 : 7	S-011	bgc-0009
1-John-1-8	If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.	1 John 1 : 8	S-064	bgc-0010
1-John-1-9	If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us <i>our</i> sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.	1 John 1 : 9	F-146	bgc-0011
1-John-2-1	My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:	1 John 2 : 1	F-240	bgc-0013
1-John-2-15	Love not the world, neither the things <i>that are</i> in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.	1 John 2 : 15	F-072	bgc-0013
1-John-2-16	For all that <i>is</i> in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.	1 John 2 : 16	S-023	bgc-0014
1-John-2-17	And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.	1 John 2 : 17	F-152	bgc-0015
1-John-2-18	Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.	1 John 2 : 18	S-098	bgc-0016
1-John-2-2	And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for <i>the sins of</i> the whole world.	1 John 2 : 2	F-233	bgc-0014
1-John-2-23	Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: (<i>but) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also</i>.	1 John 2 : 23	S-128	bgc-0007
1-John-2-24	Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.	1 John 2 : 24	S-092	bgc-0008
1-John-2-27	But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.	1 John 2 : 27	F-157	bgc-0011
1-John-2-28	And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.	1 John 2 : 28	S-104	bgc-0012
1-John-2-29	If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.	1 John 2 : 29	S-111	bgc-0013
1-John-2-3	And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.	1 John 2 : 3	S-102	bgc-0015
1-John-3-1	Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.	1 John 3 : 1	F-205	bgc-0014
1-John-3-11	For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.	1 John 3 : 11	S-126	bgc-0010
1-John-3-16	Hereby perceive we the love <i>of God</i>, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down <i>our</i> lives for the brethren.	1 John 3 : 16	S-074	bgc-0015
1-John-3-17	But whoso hath this worldâ€™s good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels <i>of compassion</i> from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?	1 John 3 : 17	F-325	bgc-0016
1-John-3-18	My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.	1 John 3 : 18	F-299	bgc-0003
1-John-3-2	Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.	1 John 3 : 2	F-091	bgc-0015
1-John-3-20	For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.	1 John 3 : 20	S-112	bgc-0005
1-John-3-21	Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, <i>then</i> have we confidence toward God.	1 John 3 : 21	F-273	bgc-0006
1-John-3-22	And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.	1 John 3 : 22	F-253	bgc-0007
1-John-3-23	And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.	1 John 3 : 23	S-001	bgc-0008
1-John-3-24	And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.	1 John 3 : 24	F-300	bgc-0009
1-John-3-3	And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.	1 John 3 : 3	S-131	bgc-0016
1-John-3-4	Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.	1 John 3 : 4	F-145	bgc-0003
1-John-3-8	He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.	1 John 3 : 8	S-089	bgc-0007
1-John-4-1	Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.	1 John 4 : 1	S-059	bgc-0010
1-John-4-10	Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son <i>to be</i> the propitiation for our sins.	1 John 4 : 10	S-129	bgc-0005
1-John-4-11	Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.	1 John 4 : 11	F-073	bgc-0006
1-John-4-12	No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.	1 John 4 : 12	F-220	bgc-0007
1-John-4-15	Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.	1 John 4 : 15	S-034	bgc-0010
1-John-4-16	And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.	1 John 4 : 16	F-041	bgc-0011
1-John-4-18	There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.	1 John 4 : 18	S-041	bgc-0013
1-John-4-19	We love him, because he first loved us.	1 John 4 : 19	S-102	bgc-0014
1-John-4-20	If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?	1 John 4 : 20	F-183	bgc-0015
1-John-4-21	And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.	1 John 4 : 21	S-052	bgc-0016
1-John-4-4	Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.	1 John 4 : 4	S-018	bgc-0013
1-John-4-5	They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.	1 John 4 : 5	F-308	bgc-0014
1-John-4-7	Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.	1 John 4 : 7	F-083	bgc-0016
1-John-4-8	He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.	1 John 4 : 8	S-123	bgc-0003
1-John-4-9	In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.	1 John 4 : 9	F-039	bgc-0004
1-John-5-1	Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.	1 John 5 : 1	S-091	bgc-0003
1-John-5-11	And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.	1 John 5 : 11	F-320	bgc-0013
1-John-5-12	He that hath the Son hath life; <i>and</i> he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.	1 John 5 : 12	S-026	bgc-0014
1-John-5-13	These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.	1 John 5 : 13	S-089	bgc-0015
1-John-5-14	And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:	1 John 5 : 14	F-045	bgc-0016
1-John-5-15	And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.	1 John 5 : 15	F-027	bgc-0003
1-John-5-20	And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, <i>even</i> in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.	1 John 5 : 20	F-316	bgc-0008
1-John-5-3	For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.	1 John 5 : 3	F-245	bgc-0005
1-John-5-4	For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, <i>even</i> our faith.	1 John 5 : 4	F-206	bgc-0006
1-John-5-5	Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?	1 John 5 : 5	F-171	bgc-0007

1-Kings-2-3	And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:	1 Kings 2 : 3	F-012	bgc-0006
1-Kings-8-23	And he said, LORD God of Israel, <i>there is</i> no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart:	1 Kings 8 : 23	F-218	bgc-0003
1-Kings-8-39	Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, <i>even</i> thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;)	1 Kings 8 : 39	S-051	bgc-0005
1-Peter-1-13	Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;	1 Peter 1 : 13	F-267	bgc-0003

1-Peter-1-2	Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.	1 Peter 1 : 2	F-255	bgc-0006
1-Peter-1-23	Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.	1 Peter 1 : 23	S-055	bgc-0013
1-Peter-1-3	Blessed <i>be</i> the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,	1 Peter 1 : 3	F-191	bgc-0007
1-Peter-1-8	Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see <i>him</i> not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:	1 Peter 1 : 8	F-178	bgc-0012
1-Peter-1-9	Receiving the end of your faith, <i>even</i> the salvation of <i>your</i> souls.	1 Peter 1 : 9	F-160	bgc-0013
1-Peter-2-10	Which in time past <i>were</i> not a people, but <i>are</i> now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.	1 Peter 2 : 10	F-116	bgc-0011
1-Peter-2-11	Dearly beloved, I beseech <i>you</i> as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;	1 Peter 2 : 11	S-021	bgc-0012
1-Peter-2-16	As free, and not using <i>your</i> liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.	1 Peter 2 : 16	S-132	bgc-0003
1-Peter-2-2	As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:	1 Peter 2 : 2	S-092	bgc-0003
1-Peter-2-21	For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:	1 Peter 2 : 21	S-085	bgc-0008
1-Peter-2-22	Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:	1 Peter 2 : 22	S-105	bgc-0009
1-Peter-2-23	Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed <i>himself</i> to him that judgeth righteously:	1 Peter 2 : 23	F-142	bgc-0010
1-Peter-2-24	Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.	1 Peter 2 : 24	F-149	bgc-0011
1-Peter-2-3	If so be ye have tasted that the Lord <i>is</i> gracious.	1 Peter 2 : 3	F-215	bgc-0004
1-Peter-2-4	To whom coming, <i>as unto</i> a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, <i>and</i> precious,	1 Peter 2 : 4	S-021	bgc-0005
1-Peter-2-9	But ye <i>are</i> a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:	1 Peter 2 : 9	S-100	bgc-0010

1-Peter-3-15	But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and <i>be</i> ready always to <i>give</i> an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:	1 Peter 3 : 15	F-115	bgc-0013
1-Peter-3-16	Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.	1 Peter 3 : 16	F-317	bgc-0014
1-Peter-3-18	For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:	1 Peter 3 : 18	F-176	bgc-0016
1-Peter-3-21	The like figure whereunto <i>even</i> baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:	1 Peter 3 : 21	F-329	bgc-0005
1-Peter-3-22	Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.	1 Peter 3 : 22	F-084	bgc-0006

1-Peter-3-9	Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.	1 Peter 3 : 9	F-269	bgc-0007
1-Peter-4-10	As every man hath received the gift, <i>even so</i> minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.	1 Peter 4 : 10	F-060	bgc-0016
1-Peter-4-7	But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.	1 Peter 4 : 7	F-065	bgc-0013
1-Peter-4-8	And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.	1 Peter 4 : 8	F-230	bgc-0014

1-Peter-5-4	And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.	1 Peter 5 : 4	F-342	bgc-0015
1-Peter-5-6	Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:	1 Peter 5 : 6	S-029	bgc-0003
1-Peter-5-7	Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.	1 Peter 5 : 7	F-141	bgc-0004
1-Peter-5-8	Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:	1 Peter 5 : 8	S-104	bgc-0005
1-Samuel-12-23	Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:	1 Samuel 12 : 23	F-078	bgc-0005
1-Samuel-15-22	And Samuel said, Hath the LORD <i>as great</i> delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey <i>is</i> better than sacrifice, <i>and</i> to hearken than the fat of rams.	1 Samuel 15 : 22	S-017	bgc-0006
1-Samuel-16-7	But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for <i>the LORD seeth</i> not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.	1 Samuel 16 : 7	F-260	bgc-0012
1-Samuel-17-45	Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.	1 Samuel 17 : 45	F-167	bgc-0003

1-Samuel-2-2	<i>There is</i> none holy as the LORD: for <i>there is</i> none beside thee: neither <i>is there</i> any rock like our God.	1 Samuel 2 : 2	S-097	bgc-0016
1-Samuel-2-3	Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let <i>not</i> arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD <i>is</i> a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.	1 Samuel 2 : 3	S-019	bgc-0003
1-Samuel-2-7	The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and lifteth up.	1 Samuel 2 : 7	F-256	bgc-0007
1-Samuel-2-8	He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, <i>and</i> lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set <i>them</i> among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth <i>are</i> the LORDâ€™s, and he hath set the world upon them.	1 Samuel 2 : 8	S-109	bgc-0008
1-Samuel-26-23	The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his faithfulness: for the LORD delivered thee into <i>my</i> hand to day, but I would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORDâ€™s anointed.	1 Samuel 26 : 23	F-270	bgc-0016
1-Samuel-8-7	And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.	1 Samuel 8 : 7	F-068	bgc-0010
1-Thessalonians-3-12	And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all <i>men</i>, even as we <i>do</i> toward you:	1 Thessalonians 3 : 12	F-312	bgc-0003
1-Thessalonians-3-13	To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.	1 Thessalonians 3 : 13	S-033	bgc-0004
1-Thessalonians-4-14	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.	1 Thessalonians 4 : 14	F-229	bgc-0004
1-Thessalonians-4-16	For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:	1 Thessalonians 4 : 16	S-054	bgc-0006
1-Thessalonians-5-11	Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.	1 Thessalonians 5 : 11	S-036	bgc-0005
1-Thessalonians-5-16	Rejoice evermore.	1 Thessalonians 5 : 16	S-093	bgc-0010
1-Thessalonians-5-17	Pray without ceasing.	1 Thessalonians 5 : 17	F-242	bgc-0011
1-Thessalonians-5-18	In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.	1 Thessalonians 5 : 18	S-041	bgc-0012
1-Thessalonians-5-2	For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.	1 Thessalonians 5 : 2	S-014	bgc-0010
1-Thessalonians-5-21	Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.	1 Thessalonians 5 : 21	F-155	bgc-0015
1-Thessalonians-5-22	Abstain from all appearance of evil.	1 Thessalonians 5 : 22	F-216	bgc-0016
1-Thessalonians-5-23	And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and <i>I pray God</i> your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.	1 Thessalonians 5 : 23	F-121	bgc-0003
1-Thessalonians-5-24	Faithful <i>is</i> he that calleth you, who also will do <i>it</i>.	1 Thessalonians 5 : 24	S-103	bgc-0004
1-Thessalonians-5-6	Therefore let us not sleep, as <i>do</i> others; but let us watch and be sober.	1 Thessalonians 5 : 6	F-244	bgc-0014
1-Thessalonians-5-9	For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,	1 Thessalonians 5 : 9	F-052	bgc-0003
1-Timothy-1-15	This <i>is</i> a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.	1 Timothy 1 : 15	F-009	bgc-0014
1-Timothy-1-16	Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.	1 Timothy 1 : 16	F-020	bgc-0015
1-Timothy-1-17	Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, <i>be</i> honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.	1 Timothy 1 : 17	F-193	bgc-0016
1-Timothy-1-4	Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: <i>so do</i>.	1 Timothy 1 : 4	S-042	bgc-0003
1-Timothy-2-1	I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, <i>and</i> giving of thanks, be made for all men;	1 Timothy 2 : 1	S-067	bgc-0006
1-Timothy-2-10	But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.	1 Timothy 2 : 10	S-065	bgc-0015
1-Timothy-2-5	For <i>there is</i> one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;	1 Timothy 2 : 5	F-108	bgc-0010
1-Timothy-2-9	In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;	1 Timothy 2 : 9	S-095	bgc-0014
1-Timothy-3-16	And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.	1 Timothy 3 : 16	S-063	bgc-0008
1-Timothy-3-5	(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)	1 Timothy 3 : 5	F-333	bgc-0011
1-Timothy-4-1	Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;	1 Timothy 4 : 1	F-332	bgc-0009
1-Timothy-4-12	Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.	1 Timothy 4 : 12	S-048	bgc-0006
1-Timothy-4-16	Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.	1 Timothy 4 : 16	F-315	bgc-0010
1-Timothy-4-8	For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.	1 Timothy 4 : 8	S-053	bgc-0016
1-Timothy-6-10	For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.	1 Timothy 6 : 10	F-179	bgc-0003
1-Timothy-6-11	But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.	1 Timothy 6 : 11	S-084	bgc-0004
1-Timothy-6-12	Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.	1 Timothy 6 : 12	F-118	bgc-0005
1-Timothy-6-6	But godliness with contentment is great gain.	1 Timothy 6 : 6	S-070	bgc-0013
1-Timothy-6-7	For we brought nothing into <i>this</i> world, <i>and it is</i> certain we can carry nothing out.	1 Timothy 6 : 7	F-236	bgc-0014
1-Timothy-6-8	And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.	1 Timothy 6 : 8	F-172	bgc-0015
1-Timothy-6-9	But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and <i>into</i> many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.	1 Timothy 6 : 9	F-089	bgc-0016
2-Chronicles-15-2	And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD <i>is</i> with you, while ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you; but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.	2 Chronicles 15 : 2	F-280	bgc-0012
2-Chronicles-15-7	Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.	2 Chronicles 15 : 7	F-231	bgc-0003
2-Chronicles-30-9	For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your children <i>shall find</i> compassion before them that lead them captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the LORD your God <i>is</i> gracious and merciful, and will not turn away <i>his</i> face from you, if ye return unto him.	2 Chronicles 30 : 9	F-125	bgc-0006
2-Chronicles-7-14	If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.	2 Chronicles 7 : 14	F-054	bgc-0012
2-Corinthians-1-3	Blessed <i>be</i> God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;	2 Corinthians 1 : 3	F-069	bgc-0003
2-Corinthians-1-4	Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.	2 Corinthians 1 : 4	F-227	bgc-0004
2-Corinthians-1-5	For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.	2 Corinthians 1 : 5	S-080	bgc-0005
2-Corinthians-10-3	For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:	2 Corinthians 10 : 3	F-021	bgc-0005
2-Corinthians-10-5	Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;	2 Corinthians 10 : 5	F-276	bgc-0007
2-Corinthians-12-10	Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christâ€™s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.	2 Corinthians 12 : 10	F-302	bgc-0007
2-Corinthians-12-9	And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.	2 Corinthians 12 : 9	S-008	bgc-0006
2-Corinthians-13-11	Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.	2 Corinthians 13 : 11	F-321	bgc-0015
2-Corinthians-13-14	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, <i>be</i> with you all. Amen.	2 Corinthians 13 : 14	F-117	bgc-0004
2-Corinthians-2-14	Now thanks <i>be</i> unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.	2 Corinthians 2 : 14	F-047	bgc-0009
2-Corinthians-2-17	For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.	2 Corinthians 2 : 17	S-131	bgc-0012
2-Corinthians-3-17	Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord <i>is</i>, there <i>is</i> liberty.	2 Corinthians 3 : 17	S-035	bgc-0015
2-Corinthians-3-18	But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, <i>even</i> as by the Spirit of the Lord.	2 Corinthians 3 : 18	F-051	bgc-0016
2-Corinthians-3-4	And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:	2 Corinthians 3 : 4	S-130	bgc-0016
2-Corinthians-3-5	Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency <i>is</i> of God;	2 Corinthians 3 : 5	S-034	bgc-0003
2-Corinthians-3-6	Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.	2 Corinthians 3 : 6	F-082	bgc-0004
2-Corinthians-4-16	For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward <i>man</i> is renewed day by day.	2 Corinthians 4 : 16	S-009	bgc-0004
2-Corinthians-4-17	For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding <i>and</i> eternal weight of glory;	2 Corinthians 4 : 17	F-275	bgc-0005
2-Corinthians-4-18	While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen <i>are</i> temporal; but the things which are not seen <i>are</i> eternal.	2 Corinthians 4 : 18	S-062	bgc-0006
2-Corinthians-4-4	In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.	2 Corinthians 4 : 4	F-034	bgc-0006
2-Corinthians-4-6	For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to <i>give</i> the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.	2 Corinthians 4 : 6	S-022	bgc-0008
2-Corinthians-5-10	For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things <i>done</i> in <i>his</i> body, according to that he hath done, whether <i>it be</i> good or bad.	2 Corinthians 5 : 10	F-131	bgc-0016
2-Corinthians-5-14	For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:	2 Corinthians 5 : 14	F-123	bgc-0006
2-Corinthians-5-15	And <i>that</i> he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.	2 Corinthians 5 : 15	F-112	bgc-0007
2-Corinthians-5-17	Therefore if any man <i>be</i> in Christ, <i>he is</i> a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.	2 Corinthians 5 : 17	F-122	bgc-0009
2-Corinthians-5-19	To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.	2 Corinthians 5 : 19	S-081	bgc-0011

2-Corinthians-5-7	(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)	2 Corinthians 5 : 7	F-261	bgc-0013
2-Corinthians-6-10	As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and <i>yet</i> possessing all things.	2 Corinthians 6 : 10	S-061	bgc-0009
2-Corinthians-6-14	Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?	2 Corinthians 6 : 14	F-185	bgc-0013
2-Corinthians-6-16	And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in <i>them</i>; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.	2 Corinthians 6 : 16	F-001	bgc-0015
2-Corinthians-7-1	Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.	2 Corinthians 7 : 1	S-031	bgc-0004

2-Corinthians-8-9	For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.	2 Corinthians 8 : 9	F-018	bgc-0014
2-Corinthians-9-10	Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for <i>your</i> food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;	2 Corinthians 9 : 10	F-126	bgc-0011
2-Corinthians-9-11	Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.	2 Corinthians 9 : 11	F-318	bgc-0012
2-Corinthians-9-7	Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, <i>so let him give</i>; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.	2 Corinthians 9 : 7	S-045	bgc-0008
2-Corinthians-9-8	And God <i>is</i> able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all <i>things</i>, may abound to every good work:	2 Corinthians 9 : 8	F-196	bgc-0009
2-John-1-10	If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into <i>your</i> house, neither bid him God speed:	2 John 1 : 10	F-254	bgc-0005
2-John-1-2	For the truthâ€™s sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.	2 John 1 : 2	F-114	bgc-0011
2-John-1-5	And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.	2 John 1 : 5	F-324	bgc-0014
2-John-1-6	And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.	2 John 1 : 6	F-239	bgc-0015
2-John-1-8	Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.	2 John 1 : 8	F-224	bgc-0003
2-Kings-20-5	Turn again, and tell Hezekiah the captain of my people, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will heal thee: on the third day thou shalt go up unto the house of the LORD.	2 Kings 20 : 5	F-241	bgc-0005

2-Peter-1-11	For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.	2 Peter 1 : 11	S-130	bgc-0008
2-Peter-1-19	We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:	2 Peter 1 : 19	S-004	bgc-0016
2-Peter-1-2	Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,	2 Peter 1 : 2	S-069	bgc-0013
2-Peter-1-20	Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.	2 Peter 1 : 20	F-330	bgc-0003
2-Peter-1-21	For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake <i>as they were</i> moved by the Holy Ghost.	2 Peter 1 : 21	S-088	bgc-0004

2-Peter-1-6	And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;	2 Peter 1 : 6	F-025	bgc-0003
2-Peter-1-7	And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.	2 Peter 1 : 7	F-050	bgc-0004

2-Peter-2-1	But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.	2 Peter 2 : 1	S-031	bgc-0005

Hebrews-10-19	Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,	Hebrews 10 : 19	F-064	bgc-0007
Hebrews-10-20	By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;	Hebrews 10 : 20	F-279	bgc-0008
Hebrews-10-21	And <i>having</i> an high priest over the house of God;	Hebrews 10 : 21	S-083	bgc-0009
Hebrews-10-22	Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.	Hebrews 10 : 22	S-046	bgc-0010
Hebrews-10-23	Let us hold fast the profession of <i>our</i> faith without wavering; (for he <i>is</i> faithful that promised;)	Hebrews 10 : 23	S-076	bgc-0011
Hebrews-10-24	And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:	Hebrews 10 : 24	S-098	bgc-0012
Hebrews-10-25	Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some <i>is</i>; but exhorting <i>one another</i>: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.	Hebrews 10 : 25	F-166	bgc-0013
Hebrews-10-26	For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,	Hebrews 10 : 26	F-151	bgc-0014
Hebrews-10-35	Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.	Hebrews 10 : 35	F-030	bgc-0009
Hebrews-11-1	Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.	Hebrews 11 : 1	S-097	bgc-0014
Hebrews-11-11	Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.	Hebrews 11 : 11	F-180	bgc-0010

Hebrews-11-6	But without faith <i>it is</i> impossible to please <i>him</i>: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and <i>that</i> he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.	Hebrews 11 : 6	S-043	bgc-0005
Hebrews-12-1	Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset <i>us</i>, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,	Hebrews 12 : 1	F-148	bgc-0011
Hebrews-12-11	Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.	Hebrews 12 : 11	F-327	bgc-0007
Hebrews-12-13	And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.	Hebrews 12 : 13	S-011	bgc-0009
Hebrews-12-14	Follow peace with all <i>men</i>, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:	Hebrews 12 : 14	F-298	bgc-0010
Hebrews-12-2	Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of <i>our</i> faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.	Hebrews 12 : 2	S-076	bgc-0012
Hebrews-12-28	Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:	Hebrews 12 : 28	S-007	bgc-0010
Hebrews-13-1	Let brotherly love continue.	Hebrews 13 : 1	F-291	bgc-0012
Hebrews-13-17	Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that <i>is</i> unprofitable for you.	Hebrews 13 : 17	S-066	bgc-0014
Hebrews-13-2	Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.	Hebrews 13 : 2	F-238	bgc-0013
Hebrews-13-20	Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,	Hebrews 13 : 20	F-271	bgc-0003
Hebrews-13-21	Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom <i>be</i> glory for ever and ever. Amen.	Hebrews 13 : 21	S-042	bgc-0004
Hebrews-13-4	Marriage <i>is</i> honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.	Hebrews 13 : 4	F-093	bgc-0015
Hebrews-13-5	<i>Let your</i> conversation <i>be</i> without covetousness; <i>and be</i> content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.	Hebrews 13 : 5	S-051	bgc-0016
Hebrews-13-6	So that we may boldly say, The Lord <i>is</i> my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.	Hebrews 13 : 6	S-116	bgc-0003
Hebrews-13-8	Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.	Hebrews 13 : 8	S-011	bgc-0005
Hebrews-2-1	Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let <i>them</i> slip.	Hebrews 2 : 1	S-064	bgc-0015
Hebrews-2-9	But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.	Hebrews 2 : 9	F-146	bgc-0009
Hebrews-3-12	Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.	Hebrews 3 : 12	F-240	bgc-0016
Hebrews-3-14	For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;	Hebrews 3 : 14	F-072	bgc-0004
Hebrews-4-10	For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God <i>did</i> from his.	Hebrews 4 : 10	S-023	bgc-0005
Hebrews-4-11	Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.	Hebrews 4 : 11	F-152	bgc-0006
Hebrews-4-12	For the word of God <i>is</i> quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and <i>is</i> a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.	Hebrews 4 : 12	S-098	bgc-0007
Hebrews-4-14	Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast <i>our</i> profession.	Hebrews 4 : 14	F-233	bgc-0009
Hebrews-4-15	For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as <i>we are, yet</i> without sin.	Hebrews 4 : 15	S-128	bgc-0010
Hebrews-4-16	Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.	Hebrews 4 : 16	S-092	bgc-0011
Hebrews-4-9	There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.	Hebrews 4 : 9	F-157	bgc-0004
Hebrews-6-10	For God <i>is</i> not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.	Hebrews 6 : 10	S-104	bgc-0007
Hebrews-6-18	That by two immutable things, in which <i>it was</i> impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:	Hebrews 6 : 18	S-111	bgc-0015
Hebrews-6-20	Whither the forerunner is for us entered, <i>even</i> Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.	Hebrews 6 : 20	S-102	bgc-0003
Hebrews-7-25	Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.	Hebrews 7 : 25	F-205	bgc-0014
Hebrews-8-1	Now of the things which we have spoken <i>this is</i> the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;	Hebrews 8 : 1	S-126	bgc-0004
Hebrews-8-6	But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.	Hebrews 8 : 6	S-074	bgc-0009
Hebrews-9-14	How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?	Hebrews 9 : 14	F-325	bgc-0016
Hebrews-9-15	And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions <i>that were</i> under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.	Hebrews 9 : 15	F-299	bgc-0003
Hebrews-9-22	And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.	Hebrews 9 : 22	F-091	bgc-0010
Hebrews-9-27	And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:	Hebrews 9 : 27	S-112	bgc-0015
Hosea-11-1	When Israel <i>was</i> a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.	Hosea 11 : 1	F-273	bgc-0006
Hosea-12-6	Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment, and wait on thy God continually.	Hosea 12 : 6	F-253	bgc-0009
Hosea-14-9	Who <i>is</i> wise, and he shall understand these <i>things</i>? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD <i>are</i> right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.	Hosea 14 : 9	S-001	bgc-0014
Hosea-2-19	And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lovingkindness, and in mercies.	Hosea 2 : 19	F-300	bgc-0015
Hosea-6-6	For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.	Hosea 6 : 6	S-131	bgc-0008
Isaiah-1-18	Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.	Isaiah 1 : 18	F-145	bgc-0004

Isaiah-11-2	And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;	Isaiah 11 : 2	S-129	bgc-0008
Isaiah-12-2	Behold, God <i>is</i> my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid: for the LORD JEHOVAH <i>is</i> my strength and <i>my</i> song; he also is become my salvation.	Isaiah 12 : 2	F-073	bgc-0010

James-2-10	For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one <i>point</i>, he is guilty of all.	James 2 : 10	F-244	bgc-0003
James-2-14	What <i>doth it</i> profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?	James 2 : 14	F-052	bgc-0007

James-3-16	For where envying and strife <i>is</i>, there <i>is</i> confusion and every evil work.	James 3 : 16	S-063	bgc-0007

James-4-10	Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.	James 4 : 10	F-315	bgc-0005
James-4-17	Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth <i>it</i> not, to him it is sin.	James 4 : 17	S-053	bgc-0012
James-4-2	Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.	James 4 : 2	F-179	bgc-0011
James-4-4	Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.	James 4 : 4	S-084	bgc-0013
James-4-6	But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.	James 4 : 6	F-118	bgc-0015
James-4-7	Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.	James 4 : 7	S-070	bgc-0016
James-4-8	Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse <i>your</i> hands, <i>ye</i> sinners; and purify <i>your</i> hearts, <i>ye</i> double minded.	James 4 : 8	F-236	bgc-0003
James-5-12	But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and <i>your</i> nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.	James 5 : 12	F-172	bgc-0010
James-5-13	Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.	James 5 : 13	F-089	bgc-0011
James-5-14	Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:	James 5 : 14	F-280	bgc-0012
James-5-15	And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.	James 5 : 15	F-231	bgc-0013
James-5-16	Confess <i>your</i> faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.	James 5 : 16	F-125	bgc-0014
James-5-7	Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.	James 5 : 7	F-054	bgc-0005
James-5-9	Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door.	James 5 : 9	F-069	bgc-0007

John-1-18	No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared <i>him</i>.	John 1 : 18	S-126	bgc-0008

John-13-13	Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for <i>so</i> I am.	John 13 : 13	S-068	bgc-0014
John-13-14	If I then, <i>your</i> Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye also ought to wash one anotherâ€™s feet.	John 13 : 14	S-080	bgc-0015

John-13-34	A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.	John 13 : 34	F-008	bgc-0007

John-14-1	Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.	John 14 : 1	S-023	bgc-0012
John-14-12	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater <i>works</i> than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.	John 14 : 12	F-017	bgc-0009

John-14-17	<i>Even</i> the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.	John 14 : 17	S-015	bgc-0014
John-14-18	I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.	John 14 : 18	F-310	bgc-0015
John-14-2	In my Fatherâ€™s house are many mansions: if <i>it were</i> not <i>so</i>, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.	John 14 : 2	F-042	bgc-0013
John-14-20	At that day ye shall know that I <i>am</i> in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.	John 14 : 20	F-228	bgc-0003
John-14-21	He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.	John 14 : 21	S-073	bgc-0004
John-14-23	Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.	John 14 : 23	F-165	bgc-0006
John-14-26	But the Comforter, <i>which is</i> the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.	John 14 : 26	F-079	bgc-0009
John-14-27	Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.	John 14 : 27	S-013	bgc-0010
John-14-3	And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, <i>there</i> ye may be also.	John 14 : 3	F-337	bgc-0014
John-14-6	Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.	John 14 : 6	S-079	bgc-0003
John-14-7	If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.	John 14 : 7	F-214	bgc-0004
John-14-8	Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.	John 14 : 8	F-016	bgc-0005
John-14-9	Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou <i>then</i>, Shew us the Father?	John 14 : 9	S-113	bgc-0006
John-15-1	I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.	John 15 : 1	F-071	bgc-0015
John-15-10	If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Fatherâ€™s commandments, and abide in his love.	John 15 : 10	F-056	bgc-0010
John-15-11	These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and <i>that</i> your joy might be full.	John 15 : 11	F-265	bgc-0011
John-15-12	This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.	John 15 : 12	S-061	bgc-0012
John-15-13	Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.	John 15 : 13	S-079	bgc-0013
John-15-14	Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.	John 15 : 14	S-093	bgc-0014
John-15-15	Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.	John 15 : 15	F-198	bgc-0015
John-15-16	Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and <i>that</i> your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.	John 15 : 16	F-262	bgc-0016
John-15-18	If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before <i>it hated</i> you.	John 15 : 18	S-067	bgc-0004
John-15-20	Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.	John 15 : 20	F-028	bgc-0006
John-15-26	But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, <i>even</i> the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:	John 15 : 26	F-288	bgc-0012
John-15-3	Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.	John 15 : 3	F-132	bgc-0003
John-15-4	Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.	John 15 : 4	F-140	bgc-0004
John-15-5	I am the vine, ye <i>are</i> the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.	John 15 : 5	F-059	bgc-0005
John-15-7	If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.	John 15 : 7	F-266	bgc-0007
John-15-9	As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.	John 15 : 9	S-022	bgc-0009
John-16-12	I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.	John 16 : 12	S-030	bgc-0011
John-16-13	Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, <i>that</i> shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.	John 16 : 13	F-268	bgc-0012
John-16-33	These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.	John 16 : 33	S-003	bgc-0004
John-16-7	Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.	John 16 : 7	F-075	bgc-0006
John-17-1	These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:	John 17 : 1	S-120	bgc-0005
John-17-11	And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we <i>are</i>.	John 17 : 11	F-202	bgc-0015
John-17-15	I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.	John 17 : 15	F-044	bgc-0005
John-17-17	Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.	John 17 : 17	F-129	bgc-0007
John-17-20	Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;	John 17 : 20	F-334	bgc-0010
John-17-21	That they all may be one; as thou, Father, <i>art</i> in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.	John 17 : 21	S-002	bgc-0011
John-17-24	Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.	John 17 : 24	F-212	bgc-0014
John-17-26	And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare <i>it</i>: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.	John 17 : 26	F-096	bgc-0016
John-17-3	And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.	John 17 : 3	S-125	bgc-0007
John-17-5	And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.	John 17 : 5	F-106	bgc-0009
John-19-30	When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.	John 19 : 30	S-007	bgc-0016
John-19-37	And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.	John 19 : 37	S-117	bgc-0009
John-2-19	Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.	John 2 : 19	S-046	bgc-0004
John-2-22	When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.	John 2 : 22	S-056	bgc-0007
John-20-17	Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and <i>to</i> my God, and your God.	John 20 : 17	F-189	bgc-0003
John-20-19	Then the same day at evening, being the first <i>day</i> of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace <i>be</i> unto you.	John 20 : 19	S-112	bgc-0005
John-20-21	Then said Jesus to them again, Peace <i>be</i> unto you: as <i>my</i> Father hath sent me, even so send I you.	John 20 : 21	S-115	bgc-0007
John-20-22	And when he had said this, he breathed on <i>them</i>, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:	John 20 : 22	F-163	bgc-0008
John-20-28	And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.	John 20 : 28	F-128	bgc-0014
John-20-29	Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed <i>are</i> they that have not seen, and <i>yet</i> have believed.	John 20 : 29	S-014	bgc-0015
John-20-8	Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.	John 20 : 8	F-232	bgc-0008
John-20-9	For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.	John 20 : 9	S-100	bgc-0009
John-21-15	So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, <i>son</i> of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.	John 21 : 15	S-040	bgc-0004
John-3-13	And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, <i>even</i> the Son of man which is in heaven.	John 3 : 13	S-065	bgc-0009
John-3-16	For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.	John 3 : 16	S-038	bgc-0012
John-3-17	For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.	John 3 : 17	F-323	bgc-0013
John-3-18	He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.	John 3 : 18	S-108	bgc-0014
John-3-19	And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.	John 3 : 19	F-097	bgc-0015
John-3-3	Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.	John 3 : 3	F-110	bgc-0013
John-3-30	He must increase, but I <i>must</i> decrease.	John 3 : 30	F-006	bgc-0012
John-3-36	He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.	John 3 : 36	F-294	bgc-0004
John-3-5	Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and <i>of</i> the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.	John 3 : 5	F-032	bgc-0015
John-3-6	That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.	John 3 : 6	S-127	bgc-0016
John-3-7	Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.	John 3 : 7	S-059	bgc-0003
John-3-8	The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.	John 3 : 8	S-038	bgc-0004
John-4-13	Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:	John 4 : 13	F-011	bgc-0003
John-4-14	But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.	John 4 : 14	F-250	bgc-0004

Matthew-20-27	And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant:	Matthew 20 : 27	F-166	bgc-0003

Matthew-28-18	And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.	Matthew 28 : 18	S-074	bgc-0004
Matthew-28-19	Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:	Matthew 28 : 19	F-325	bgc-0005

Matthew-5-15	Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.	Matthew 5 : 15	F-041	bgc-0007

Matthew-5-3	Blessed <i>are</i> the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.	Matthew 5 : 3	F-083	bgc-0009

Matthew-5-36	Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black.	Matthew 5 : 36	F-039	bgc-0014

Matthew-6-10	Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as <i>it is</i> in heaven.	Matthew 6 : 10	F-012	bgc-0008
Matthew-6-11	Give us this day our daily bread.	Matthew 6 : 11	F-218	bgc-0009

Matthew-6-13	And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.	Matthew 6 : 13	F-267	bgc-0011
Matthew-6-14	For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:	Matthew 6 : 14	S-050	bgc-0012
Matthew-6-16	Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.	Matthew 6 : 16	F-255	bgc-0014
Matthew-6-17	But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;	Matthew 6 : 17	S-055	bgc-0015
Matthew-6-18	That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.	Matthew 6 : 18	F-191	bgc-0016
Matthew-6-19	Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:	Matthew 6 : 19	F-178	bgc-0003
Matthew-6-2	Therefore when thou doest <i>thine</i> alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.	Matthew 6 : 2	F-160	bgc-0014
Matthew-6-20	But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:	Matthew 6 : 20	F-116	bgc-0004
Matthew-6-21	For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.	Matthew 6 : 21	S-021	bgc-0005
Matthew-6-22	The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.	Matthew 6 : 22	S-132	bgc-0006
Matthew-6-23	But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great <i>is</i> that darkness!	Matthew 6 : 23	S-092	bgc-0007
Matthew-6-24	No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.	Matthew 6 : 24	S-085	bgc-0008
Matthew-6-25	Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?	Matthew 6 : 25	S-105	bgc-0009
Matthew-6-26	Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?	Matthew 6 : 26	F-142	bgc-0010
Matthew-6-27	Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?	Matthew 6 : 27	F-149	bgc-0011
Matthew-6-28	And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:	Matthew 6 : 28	F-215	bgc-0012
Matthew-6-3	But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:	Matthew 6 : 3	S-021	bgc-0015
Matthew-6-30	Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, <i>shall he</i> not much more <i>clothe</i> you, O ye of little faith?	Matthew 6 : 30	S-100	bgc-0014
Matthew-6-33	But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.	Matthew 6 : 33	F-120	bgc-0003
Matthew-6-34	Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day <i>is</i> the evil thereof.	Matthew 6 : 34	F-100	bgc-0004
Matthew-6-4	That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.	Matthew 6 : 4	F-115	bgc-0016
Matthew-6-5	And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites <i>are</i>: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.	Matthew 6 : 5	F-317	bgc-0003
Matthew-6-6	But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.	Matthew 6 : 6	F-176	bgc-0004
Matthew-6-9	After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.	Matthew 6 : 9	F-329	bgc-0007
Matthew-7-1	Judge not, that ye be not judged.	Matthew 7 : 1	F-084	bgc-0005
Matthew-7-12	Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.	Matthew 7 : 12	S-019	bgc-0016
Matthew-7-13	Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide <i>is</i> the gate, and broad <i>is</i> the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:	Matthew 7 : 13	F-269	bgc-0003
Matthew-7-14	Because strait <i>is</i> the gate, and narrow <i>is</i> the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.	Matthew 7 : 14	F-060	bgc-0004
Matthew-7-15	Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheepâ€™s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.	Matthew 7 : 15	F-065	bgc-0005
Matthew-7-21	Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.	Matthew 7 : 21	F-230	bgc-0011

Romans-1-11	For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;	Romans 1 : 11	S-129	bgc-0009
Romans-1-12	That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.	Romans 1 : 12	F-073	bgc-0010
Romans-1-16	For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.	Romans 1 : 16	F-220	bgc-0014
Romans-1-17	For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.	Romans 1 : 17	S-034	bgc-0015
Romans-1-18	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;	Romans 1 : 18	F-041	bgc-0016
Romans-1-7	To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called <i>to be</i> saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.	Romans 1 : 7	S-041	bgc-0005
Romans-10-10	For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.	Romans 10 : 10	S-102	bgc-0014
Romans-10-11	For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.	Romans 10 : 11	F-183	bgc-0015
Romans-10-12	For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.	Romans 10 : 12	S-052	bgc-0016
Romans-10-13	For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.	Romans 10 : 13	S-018	bgc-0003
Romans-10-14	How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?	Romans 10 : 14	F-308	bgc-0004
Romans-10-17	So then faith <i>cometh</i> by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.	Romans 10 : 17	F-083	bgc-0007
Romans-10-4	For Christ <i>is</i> the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.	Romans 10 : 4	S-123	bgc-0008
Romans-10-9	That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.	Romans 10 : 9	F-039	bgc-0013
Romans-11-25	For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.	Romans 11 : 25	S-091	bgc-0008
Romans-11-33	O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable <i>are</i> his judgments, and his ways past finding out!	Romans 11 : 33	F-320	bgc-0016
Romans-11-36	For of him, and through him, and to him, <i>are</i> all things: to whom <i>be</i> glory for ever. Amen.	Romans 11 : 36	S-026	bgc-0005
Romans-12-1	I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, <i>which is</i> your reasonable service.	Romans 12 : 1	S-089	bgc-0006
Romans-12-10	<i>Be</i> kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;	Romans 12 : 10	F-045	bgc-0015
Romans-12-11	Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;	Romans 12 : 11	F-027	bgc-0016
Romans-12-12	Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;	Romans 12 : 12	F-316	bgc-0003
Romans-12-14	Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.	Romans 12 : 14	F-245	bgc-0005
Romans-12-15	Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.	Romans 12 : 15	F-206	bgc-0006
Romans-12-16	<i>Be</i> of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.	Romans 12 : 16	F-171	bgc-0007
Romans-12-18	If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.	Romans 12 : 18	S-017	bgc-0009
Romans-12-2	And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what <i>is</i> that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.	Romans 12 : 2	F-012	bgc-0007
Romans-12-20	Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.	Romans 12 : 20	F-218	bgc-0011
Romans-12-21	Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.	Romans 12 : 21	S-051	bgc-0012
Romans-12-3	For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think <i>of himself</i> more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.	Romans 12 : 3	F-267	bgc-0008
Romans-12-4	For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:	Romans 12 : 4	S-050	bgc-0009
Romans-12-5	So we, <i>being</i> many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.	Romans 12 : 5	F-255	bgc-0010
Romans-12-9	<i>Let</i> love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.	Romans 12 : 9	S-055	bgc-0014
Romans-13-1	Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.	Romans 13 : 1	F-191	bgc-0013
Romans-13-10	Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love <i>is</i> the fulfilling of the law.	Romans 13 : 10	F-178	bgc-0008
Romans-13-14	But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to <i>fulfil</i> the lusts <i>thereof</i>.	Romans 13 : 14	F-160	bgc-0012
Romans-13-7	Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute <i>is due</i>; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.	Romans 13 : 7	F-116	bgc-0005
Romans-13-8	Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.	Romans 13 : 8	S-021	bgc-0006
Romans-13-9	For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if <i>there be</i> any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.	Romans 13 : 9	S-132	bgc-0007
Romans-14-1	Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, <i>but</i> not to doubtful disputations.	Romans 14 : 1	S-092	bgc-0013
Romans-14-11	For it is written, <i>As</i> I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.	Romans 14 : 11	S-085	bgc-0009
Romans-14-17	For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.	Romans 14 : 17	S-105	bgc-0015
Romans-14-4	Who art thou that judgest another manâ€™s servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.	Romans 14 : 4	F-142	bgc-0016
Romans-14-8	For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lordâ€™s.	Romans 14 : 8	F-149	bgc-0006
Romans-14-9	For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.	Romans 14 : 9	F-215	bgc-0007
Romans-15-13	Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.	Romans 15 : 13	S-021	bgc-0006
Romans-15-2	Let every one of us please <i>his</i> neighbour for <i>his</i> good to edification.	Romans 15 : 2	S-100	bgc-0009
Romans-15-4	For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.	Romans 15 : 4	F-120	bgc-0011
Romans-15-5	Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:	Romans 15 : 5	F-100	bgc-0012
Romans-15-7	Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.	Romans 15 : 7	F-115	bgc-0014
Romans-16-20	And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with you. Amen.	Romans 16 : 20	F-317	bgc-0004
Romans-2-1	Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.	Romans 2 : 1	F-176	bgc-0003
Romans-2-6	Who will render to every man according to his deeds:	Romans 2 : 6	F-329	bgc-0008
Romans-3-10	As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:	Romans 3 : 10	F-084	bgc-0013
Romans-3-21	But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;	Romans 3 : 21	S-019	bgc-0010
Romans-3-22	Even the righteousness of God <i>which is</i> by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:	Romans 3 : 22	F-269	bgc-0011
Romans-3-23	For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;	Romans 3 : 23	F-060	bgc-0012
Romans-3-24	Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:	Romans 3 : 24	F-065	bgc-0013
Romans-3-25	Whom God hath set forth <i>to be</i> a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;	Romans 3 : 25	F-230	bgc-0014
Romans-4-7	<i>Saying</i>, Blessed <i>are</i> they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.	Romans 4 : 7	F-221	bgc-0013
Romans-5-1	Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:	Romans 5 : 1	F-342	bgc-0004
Romans-5-15	But not as the offence, so also <i>is</i> the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, <i>which is</i> by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.	Romans 5 : 15	S-029	bgc-0004
Romans-5-3	And not only <i>so</i>, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;	Romans 5 : 3	F-141	bgc-0006
Romans-5-4	And patience, experience; and experience, hope:	Romans 5 : 4	S-104	bgc-0007
Romans-5-5	And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.	Romans 5 : 5	F-078	bgc-0008
Romans-5-6	For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.	Romans 5 : 6	S-017	bgc-0009
Romans-5-8	But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.	Romans 5 : 8	F-260	bgc-0011
Romans-5-9	Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.	Romans 5 : 9	F-167	bgc-0012
Romans-6-1	What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?	Romans 6 : 1	S-110	bgc-0011
Romans-6-13	Neither yield ye your members <i>as</i> instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members <i>as</i> instruments of righteousness unto God.	Romans 6 : 13	S-097	bgc-0009
Romans-6-14	For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.	Romans 6 : 14	S-019	bgc-0010
Romans-6-15	What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.	Romans 6 : 15	F-256	bgc-0011
Romans-6-17	But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.	Romans 6 : 17	S-109	bgc-0013
Romans-6-22	But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.	Romans 6 : 22	F-270	bgc-0004
Romans-6-23	For the wages of sin <i>is</i> death; but the gift of God <i>is</i> eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.	Romans 6 : 23	F-068	bgc-0005
Romans-6-3	Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?	Romans 6 : 3	F-312	bgc-0013
Romans-6-4	Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.	Romans 6 : 4	S-033	bgc-0014
Romans-7-7	What shall we say then? <i>Is</i> the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.	Romans 7 : 7	F-229	bgc-0012
Romans-8-1	<i>There is</i> therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.	Romans 8 : 1	S-054	bgc-0003
Romans-8-11	But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.	Romans 8 : 11	S-036	bgc-0013
Romans-8-14	For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.	Romans 8 : 14	S-093	bgc-0016
Romans-8-15	For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.	Romans 8 : 15	F-242	bgc-0003
Romans-8-16	The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:	Romans 8 : 16	S-041	bgc-0004
Romans-8-18	For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time <i>are</i> not worthy <i>to be compared</i> with the glory which shall be revealed in us.	Romans 8 : 18	S-014	bgc-0006
Romans-8-2	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.	Romans 8 : 2	F-155	bgc-0004
Romans-8-25	But if we hope for that we see not, <i>then</i> do we with patience wait for <i>it</i>.	Romans 8 : 25	F-216	bgc-0013
Romans-8-26	Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.	Romans 8 : 26	F-121	bgc-0014
Romans-8-28	And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to <i>his</i> purpose.	Romans 8 : 28	S-103	bgc-0016
Romans-8-29	For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate <i>to be</i> conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.	Romans 8 : 29	F-244	bgc-0003
Romans-8-31	What shall we then say to these things? If God <i>be</i> for us, who <i>can be</i> against us?	Romans 8 : 31	F-052	bgc-0005
Romans-8-32	He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?	Romans 8 : 32	F-009	bgc-0006
Romans-8-35	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? <i>shall</i> tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?	Romans 8 : 35	F-020	bgc-0009
Romans-8-37	Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.	Romans 8 : 37	F-193	bgc-0011
Romans-8-38	For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,	Romans 8 : 38	S-042	bgc-0012
Romans-8-39	Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.	Romans 8 : 39	S-067	bgc-0013
Romans-8-6	For to be carnally minded <i>is</i> death; but to be spiritually minded <i>is</i> life and peace.	Romans 8 : 6	S-065	bgc-0008
Romans-8-7	Because the carnal mind <i>is</i> enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.	Romans 8 : 7	F-108	bgc-0009
Romans-8-8	So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.	Romans 8 : 8	S-095	bgc-0010
Romans-8-9	But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.	Romans 8 : 9	S-063	bgc-0011
Romans-9-33	As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.	Romans 9 : 33	F-333	bgc-0004
Ruth-1-16	And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, <i>or</i> to return from following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people <i>shall be</i> my people, and thy God my God:	Ruth 1 : 16	F-332	bgc-0010
Song-of-Songs-2-1	I <i>am</i> the rose of Sharon, <i>and</i> the lily of the valleys.	Song of Songs 2 : 1	S-048	bgc-0007
Song-of-Songs-8-6	Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love <i>is</i> strong as death; jealousy <i>is</i> cruel as the grave: the coals thereof <i>are</i> coals of fire, <i>which hath</i> a most vehement flame.	Song of Songs 8 : 6	F-315	bgc-0014
Titus-1-2	In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;	Titus 1 : 2	S-053	bgc-0015
Titus-1-9	Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.	Titus 1 : 9	F-179	bgc-0008
Titus-2-1	But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:	Titus 2 : 1	S-084	bgc-0016
Titus-2-11	For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,	Titus 2 : 11	F-118	bgc-0012
Titus-2-13	Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;	Titus 2 : 13	S-070	bgc-0014
Titus-2-14	Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.	Titus 2 : 14	F-236	bgc-0015
Titus-3-10	A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;	Titus 3 : 10	F-172	bgc-0012
Titus-3-2	To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, <i>but</i> gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.	Titus 3 : 2	F-089	bgc-0004
Titus-3-3	For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, <i>and</i> hating one another.	Titus 3 : 3	F-280	bgc-0005
Titus-3-5	Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;	Titus 3 : 5	F-231	bgc-0007
Titus-3-7	That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.	Titus 3 : 7	F-125	bgc-0009
Zechariah-1-3	Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye unto me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn unto you, saith the LORD of hosts.	Zechariah 1 : 3	F-054	bgc-0015
Zechariah-10-6	And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them; for I have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I <i>am</i> the LORD their God, and will hear them.	Zechariah 10 : 6	F-069	bgc-0016
Zechariah-12-10	And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for <i>his</i> only <i>son</i>, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for <i>his</i> firstborn.	Zechariah 12 : 10	F-227	bgc-0007
Zechariah-4-6	Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This <i>is</i> the word of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.	Zechariah 4 : 6	S-080	bgc-0006
Zechariah-7-10	And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart.	Zechariah 7 : 10	F-021	bgc-0008
Zechariah-7-9	Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his brother:	Zechariah 7 : 9	F-276	bgc-0007
Zechariah-9-9	Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he <i>is</i> just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.	Zechariah 9 : 9	F-302	bgc-0016
Zephaniah-2-3	Seek ye the LORD, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of the LORDâ€™s anger.	Zephaniah 2 : 3	S-008	bgc-0012
Zephaniah-3-14	Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.	Zephaniah 3 : 14	F-321	bgc-0010
Zephaniah-3-15	The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the king of Israel, <i>even</i> the LORD, <i>is</i> in the midst of thee: thou shalt not see evil any more.	Zephaniah 3 : 15	F-117	bgc-0011
Zephaniah-3-16	In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: <i>and to</i> Zion, Let not thine hands be slack.	Zephaniah 3 : 16	F-047	bgc-0012
Zephaniah-3-17	The LORD thy God in the midst of thee <i>is</i> mighty; he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing.	Zephaniah 3 : 17	S-131	bgc-0013
