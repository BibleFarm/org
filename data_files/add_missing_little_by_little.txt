Acts-7-55	But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,	Acts 7 : 55	Flowers_0001_57	bgc-0010
Acts-7-56	And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.	Acts 7 : 56	Flowers_0001_58	bgc-0011
Acts-7-57	Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,	Acts 7 : 57	Flowers_0001_59	bgc-0012
Acts-7-58	And cast <i>him</i> out of the city, and stoned <i>him</i>: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young manâ€™s feet, whose name was Saul.	Acts 7 : 58	Flowers_0001_60	bgc-0013
Acts-7-59	And they stoned Stephen, calling upon <i>God</i>, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.	Acts 7 : 59	Flowers_0001_61	bgc-0014
Acts-7-60	And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.	Acts 7 : 60	Flowers_0001_62	bgc-0015
Acts-8-1	And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.	Acts 8 : 1	Flowers_0001_63	bgc-0016
Acts-8-2	And devout men carried Stephen <i>to his burial</i>, and made great lamentation over him.	Acts 8 : 2	Flowers_0001_64	bgc-0003

Acts-8-5	Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.	Acts 8 : 5	Flowers_0001_67	bgc-0006
Acts-8-6	And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.	Acts 8 : 6	Flowers_0001_68	bgc-0007
Acts-8-7	For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed <i>with them</i>: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.	Acts 8 : 7	Flowers_0001_69	bgc-0008
Acts-8-8	And there was great joy in that city.	Acts 8 : 8	Flowers_0001_70	bgc-0009
Acts-8-9	But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:	Acts 8 : 9	Flowers_0001_71	bgc-0010
Acts-8-10	To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.	Acts 8 : 10	Flowers_0001_72	bgc-0011

Acts-8-15	Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:	Acts 8 : 15	Flowers_0001_77	bgc-0016
Acts-8-16	(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)	Acts 8 : 16	Flowers_0001_78	bgc-0003
Acts-8-17	Then laid they <i>their</i> hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.	Acts 8 : 17	Flowers_0001_79	bgc-0004
Acts-8-18	And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostlesâ€™ hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,	Acts 8 : 18	Flowers_0001_80	bgc-0005
Acts-8-19	Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.	Acts 8 : 19	Flowers_0001_81	bgc-0006
Acts-8-20	But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.	Acts 8 : 20	Flowers_0001_82	bgc-0007
Acts-8-21	Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.	Acts 8 : 21	Flowers_0001_83	bgc-0008
Acts-8-22	Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.	Acts 8 : 22	Flowers_0001_84	bgc-0009
Acts-8-23	For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and <i>in</i> the bond of iniquity.	Acts 8 : 23	Flowers_0001_85	bgc-0010
Acts-8-24	Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.	Acts 8 : 24	Flowers_0001_86	bgc-0011

Acts-8-27	And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,	Acts 8 : 27	Flowers_0001_89	bgc-0014
Acts-8-28	Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.	Acts 8 : 28	Flowers_0001_90	bgc-0015

Acts-8-30	And Philip ran thither to <i>him</i>, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?	Acts 8 : 30	Flowers_0001_92	bgc-0003
Acts-8-31	And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.	Acts 8 : 31	Flowers_0001_93	bgc-0004
Acts-8-32	The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:	Acts 8 : 32	Flowers_0001_94	bgc-0005
Acts-8-33	In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.	Acts 8 : 33	Flowers_0001_95	bgc-0006
Acts-8-34	And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?	Acts 8 : 34	Flowers_0001_96	bgc-0007
Acts-8-35	Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.	Acts 8 : 35	Flowers_0001_97	bgc-0008
Acts-8-36	And as they went on <i>their</i> way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, <i>here is</i> water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?	Acts 8 : 36	Flowers_0001_98	bgc-0009
Acts-8-37	And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.	Acts 8 : 37	Flowers_0001_99	bgc-0010
Acts-8-38	And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.	Acts 8 : 38	Flowers_0001_100	bgc-0011

Acts-9-3	And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:	Acts 9 : 3	Flowers_0001_105	bgc-0016
Acts-9-4	And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?	Acts 9 : 4	Flowers_0001_106	bgc-0003
Acts-9-5	And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: <i>it is</i> hard for thee to kick against the pricks.	Acts 9 : 5	Flowers_0001_107	bgc-0004
Acts-9-6	And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord <i>said</i> unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.	Acts 9 : 6	Flowers_0001_108	bgc-0005

Acts-9-11	And the Lord <i>said</i> unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for <i>one</i> called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,	Acts 9 : 11	Flowers_0001_113	bgc-0010
Acts-9-12	And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting <i>his</i> hand on him, that he might receive his sight.	Acts 9 : 12	Flowers_0001_114	bgc-0011

Acts-9-14	And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name.	Acts 9 : 14	Flowers_0001_116	bgc-0013
Acts-9-15	But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:	Acts 9 : 15	Flowers_0001_117	bgc-0014

Acts-9-20	And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.	Acts 9 : 20	Flowers_0001_122	bgc-0005
Acts-9-21	But all that heard <i>him</i> were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?	Acts 9 : 21	Flowers_0001_123	bgc-0006
Acts-9-22	But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.	Acts 9 : 22	Flowers_0001_124	bgc-0007
Acts-9-23	And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:	Acts 9 : 23	Flowers_0001_125	bgc-0008

Acts-17-7	Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, <i>one</i> Jesus.	Acts 17 : 7	Flowers_0001_72	bgc-0004
Acts-17-8	And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.	Acts 17 : 8	Flowers_0001_73	bgc-0005
Acts-17-9	And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go.	Acts 17 : 9	Flowers_0001_74	bgc-0006
Acts-17-10	And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming <i>thither</i> went into the synagogue of the Jews.	Acts 17 : 10	Flowers_0001_75	bgc-0007
Acts-17-11	These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.	Acts 17 : 11	Flowers_0001_76	bgc-0008
Acts-17-12	Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which were Greeks, and of men, not a few.	Acts 17 : 12	Flowers_0001_77	bgc-0009
Acts-17-13	But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.	Acts 17 : 13	Flowers_0001_78	bgc-0010
Acts-17-14	And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.	Acts 17 : 14	Flowers_0001_79	bgc-0011
Acts-17-15	And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with all speed, they departed.	Acts 17 : 15	Flowers_0001_80	bgc-0012
Acts-17-16	Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.	Acts 17 : 16	Flowers_0001_81	bgc-0013
Acts-17-17	Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.	Acts 17 : 17	Flowers_0001_82	bgc-0014
Acts-17-18	Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.	Acts 17 : 18	Flowers_0001_83	bgc-0015
Acts-17-19	And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, <i>is</i>?	Acts 17 : 19	Flowers_0001_84	bgc-0016
Acts-17-20	For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.	Acts 17 : 20	Flowers_0001_85	bgc-0003
Acts-17-21	(For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing.)	Acts 17 : 21	Flowers_0001_86	bgc-0004
Acts-17-22	Then Paul stood in the midst of Marsâ€™ hill, and said, <i>Ye</i> men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.	Acts 17 : 22	Flowers_0001_87	bgc-0005
Acts-17-23	For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.	Acts 17 : 23	Flowers_0001_88	bgc-0006
Acts-17-24	God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;	Acts 17 : 24	Flowers_0001_89	bgc-0007
Acts-17-25	Neither is worshipped with menâ€™s hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;	Acts 17 : 25	Flowers_0001_90	bgc-0008
Acts-17-26	And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;	Acts 17 : 26	Flowers_0001_91	bgc-0009
Acts-17-27	That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:	Acts 17 : 27	Flowers_0001_92	bgc-0010
Acts-17-28	For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.	Acts 17 : 28	Flowers_0001_93	bgc-0011
Acts-17-29	Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and manâ€™s device.	Acts 17 : 29	Flowers_0001_94	bgc-0012
Acts-17-30	And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:	Acts 17 : 30	Flowers_0001_95	bgc-0013
Acts-17-31	Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by <i>that</i> man whom he hath ordained; <i>whereof</i> he hath given assurance unto all <i>men</i>, in that he hath raised him from the dead.	Acts 17 : 31	Flowers_0001_96	bgc-0014
Acts-17-32	And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this <i>matter</i>.	Acts 17 : 32	Flowers_0001_97	bgc-0015
Acts-17-33	So Paul departed from among them.	Acts 17 : 33	Flowers_0001_98	bgc-0016
Acts-17-34	Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the which <i>was</i> Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.	Acts 17 : 34	Flowers_0001_99	bgc-0003

Acts-18-2	And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.	Acts 18 : 2	Flowers_0001_101	bgc-0005

Acts-18-6	And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook <i>his</i> raiment, and said unto them, Your blood <i>be</i> upon your own heads; I <i>am</i> clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.	Acts 18 : 6	Flowers_0001_105	bgc-0009
Acts-18-7	And he departed thence, and entered into a certain <i>manâ€™s</i> house, named Justus, <i>one</i> that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.	Acts 18 : 7	Flowers_0001_106	bgc-0010

Acts-18-13	Saying, This <i>fellow</i> persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.	Acts 18 : 13	Flowers_0001_112	bgc-0016
Acts-18-14	And when Paul was now about to open <i>his</i> mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O <i>ye</i> Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:	Acts 18 : 14	Flowers_0001_113	bgc-0003
Acts-18-15	But if it be a question of words and names, and <i>of</i> your law, look ye <i>to it</i>; for I will be no judge of such <i>matters</i>.	Acts 18 : 15	Flowers_0001_114	bgc-0004
Acts-18-16	And he drave them from the judgment seat.	Acts 18 : 16	Flowers_0001_115	bgc-0005

Acts-18-18	And Paul <i>after this</i> tarried <i>there</i> yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn <i>his</i> head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.	Acts 18 : 18	Flowers_0001_117	bgc-0007
Acts-18-19	And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.	Acts 18 : 19	Flowers_0001_118	bgc-0008
Acts-18-20	When they desired <i>him</i> to tarry longer time with them, he consented not;	Acts 18 : 20	Flowers_0001_119	bgc-0009
Acts-18-21	But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.	Acts 18 : 21	Flowers_0001_120	bgc-0010

Acts-19-10	And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.	Acts 19 : 10	Flowers_0001_137	bgc-0013
Acts-19-11	And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:	Acts 19 : 11	Flowers_0001_138	bgc-0014
Acts-19-12	So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.	Acts 19 : 12	Flowers_0001_139	bgc-0015
Acts-19-13	Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.	Acts 19 : 13	Flowers_0001_140	bgc-0016
Acts-19-14	And there were seven sons of <i>one</i> Sceva, a Jew, <i>and</i> chief of the priests, which did so.	Acts 19 : 14	Flowers_0001_141	bgc-0003
Acts-19-15	And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?	Acts 19 : 15	Flowers_0001_142	bgc-0004
Acts-19-16	And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.	Acts 19 : 16	Flowers_0001_143	bgc-0005
Acts-19-17	And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.	Acts 19 : 17	Flowers_0001_144	bgc-0006
Acts-19-18	And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their deeds.	Acts 19 : 18	Flowers_0001_145	bgc-0007
Acts-19-19	Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all <i>men</i>: and they counted the price of them, and found <i>it</i> fifty thousand <i>pieces</i> of silver.	Acts 19 : 19	Flowers_0001_146	bgc-0008
Acts-19-20	So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.	Acts 19 : 20	Flowers_0001_147	bgc-0009
Acts-19-21	After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.	Acts 19 : 21	Flowers_0001_148	bgc-0010
Acts-19-22	So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.	Acts 19 : 22	Flowers_0001_149	bgc-0011
Acts-19-23	And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.	Acts 19 : 23	Flowers_0001_150	bgc-0012
Acts-19-24	For a certain <i>man</i> named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;	Acts 19 : 24	Flowers_0001_151	bgc-0013
Acts-19-25	Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.	Acts 19 : 25	Flowers_0001_152	bgc-0014
Acts-19-26	Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:	Acts 19 : 26	Flowers_0001_153	bgc-0015
Acts-19-27	So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worshippeth.	Acts 19 : 27	Flowers_0001_154	bgc-0016
Acts-19-28	And when they heard <i>these sayings</i>, they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great <i>is</i> Diana of the Ephesians.	Acts 19 : 28	Flowers_0001_155	bgc-0003
Acts-19-29	And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paulâ€™s companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.	Acts 19 : 29	Flowers_0001_156	bgc-0004
Acts-19-30	And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.	Acts 19 : 30	Flowers_0001_157	bgc-0005
Acts-19-31	And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent unto him, desiring <i>him</i> that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.	Acts 19 : 31	Flowers_0001_158	bgc-0006
Acts-19-32	Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.	Acts 19 : 32	Flowers_0001_159	bgc-0007
Acts-19-33	And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defence unto the people.	Acts 19 : 33	Flowers_0001_160	bgc-0008
Acts-19-34	But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great <i>is</i> Diana of the Ephesians.	Acts 19 : 34	Flowers_0001_161	bgc-0009
Acts-19-35	And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, <i>Ye</i> men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the <i>image</i> which fell down from Jupiter?	Acts 19 : 35	Flowers_0001_162	bgc-0010
Acts-19-36	Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.	Acts 19 : 36	Flowers_0001_163	bgc-0011
Acts-19-37	For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.	Acts 19 : 37	Flowers_0001_164	bgc-0012
Acts-19-38	Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them implead one another.	Acts 19 : 38	Flowers_0001_165	bgc-0013
Acts-19-39	But if ye inquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.	Acts 19 : 39	Flowers_0001_166	bgc-0014
Acts-19-40	For we are in danger to be called in question for this dayâ€™s uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.	Acts 19 : 40	Flowers_0001_167	bgc-0015
Acts-19-41	And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.	Acts 19 : 41	Flowers_0001_168	bgc-0016
Acts-20-1	And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto <i>him</i> the disciples, and embraced <i>them</i>, and departed for to go into Macedonia.	Acts 20 : 1	Flowers_0001_169	bgc-0003
Acts-20-2	And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,	Acts 20 : 2	Flowers_0001_170	bgc-0004
Acts-20-3	And <i>there</i> abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.	Acts 20 : 3	Flowers_0001_171	bgc-0005
Acts-20-4	And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.	Acts 20 : 4	Flowers_0001_172	bgc-0006
Acts-20-5	These going before tarried for us at Troas.	Acts 20 : 5	Flowers_0001_173	bgc-0007
Acts-20-6	And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days.	Acts 20 : 6	Flowers_0001_174	bgc-0008
Acts-20-7	And upon the first <i>day</i> of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.	Acts 20 : 7	Flowers_0001_175	bgc-0009
Acts-20-8	And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.	Acts 20 : 8	Flowers_0001_176	bgc-0010
Acts-20-9	And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.	Acts 20 : 9	Flowers_0001_177	bgc-0011
Acts-20-10	And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing <i>him</i> said, Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.	Acts 20 : 10	Flowers_0001_178	bgc-0012
Acts-20-11	When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.	Acts 20 : 11	Flowers_0001_179	bgc-0013
Acts-20-12	And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.	Acts 20 : 12	Flowers_0001_180	bgc-0014
Acts-20-13	And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.	Acts 20 : 13	Flowers_0001_181	bgc-0015
Acts-20-14	And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.	Acts 20 : 14	Flowers_0001_182	bgc-0016
Acts-20-15	And we sailed thence, and came the next <i>day</i> over against Chios; and the next <i>day</i> we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next <i>day</i> we came to Miletus.	Acts 20 : 15	Flowers_0001_183	bgc-0003
Acts-20-16	For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.	Acts 20 : 16	Flowers_0001_184	bgc-0004
Acts-20-17	And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.	Acts 20 : 17	Flowers_0001_185	bgc-0005

Acts-22-24	The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.	Acts 22 : 24	Flowers_0001_270	bgc-0006

Acts-22-29	Then straightway they departed from him which should have examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.	Acts 22 : 29	Flowers_0001_275	bgc-0011
Acts-22-30	On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from <i>his</i> bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.	Acts 22 : 30	Flowers_0001_276	bgc-0012
Acts-23-1	And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men <i>and</i> brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.	Acts 23 : 1	Flowers_0001_277	bgc-0013

Acts-23-4	And they that stood by said, Revilest thou Godâ€™s high priest?	Acts 23 : 4	Flowers_0001_280	bgc-0016
Acts-23-5	Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.	Acts 23 : 5	Flowers_0001_281	bgc-0003
Acts-23-6	But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men <i>and</i> brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.	Acts 23 : 6	Flowers_0001_282	bgc-0004
Acts-23-7	And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.	Acts 23 : 7	Flowers_0001_283	bgc-0005
Acts-23-8	For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.	Acts 23 : 8	Flowers_0001_284	bgc-0006
Acts-23-9	And there arose a great cry: and the scribes <i>that were</i> of the Phariseesâ€™ part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight against God.	Acts 23 : 9	Flowers_0001_285	bgc-0007

Acts-23-12	And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.	Acts 23 : 12	Flowers_0001_288	bgc-0010
Acts-23-13	And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.	Acts 23 : 13	Flowers_0001_289	bgc-0011
Acts-23-14	And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.	Acts 23 : 14	Flowers_0001_290	bgc-0012
Acts-23-15	Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would inquire something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.	Acts 23 : 15	Flowers_0001_291	bgc-0013
Acts-23-16	And when Paulâ€™s sisterâ€™s son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.	Acts 23 : 16	Flowers_0001_292	bgc-0014
Acts-23-17	Then Paul called one of the centurions unto <i>him</i>, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.	Acts 23 : 17	Flowers_0001_293	bgc-0015
Acts-23-18	So he took him, and brought <i>him</i> to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto <i>him</i>, and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.	Acts 23 : 18	Flowers_0001_294	bgc-0016
Acts-23-19	Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went <i>with him</i> aside privately, and asked <i>him</i>, What is that thou hast to tell me?	Acts 23 : 19	Flowers_0001_295	bgc-0003
Acts-23-20	And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly.	Acts 23 : 20	Flowers_0001_296	bgc-0004
Acts-23-21	But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.	Acts 23 : 21	Flowers_0001_297	bgc-0005

Acts-24-10	Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:	Acts 24 : 10	Flowers_0001_321	bgc-0015
Acts-24-11	Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.	Acts 24 : 11	Flowers_0001_322	bgc-0016

Acts-25-3	And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.	Acts 25 : 3	Flowers_0001_341	bgc-0007
Acts-25-4	But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly <i>thither</i>.	Acts 25 : 4	Flowers_0001_342	bgc-0008
Acts-25-5	Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down with <i>me</i>, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.	Acts 25 : 5	Flowers_0001_343	bgc-0009

Acts-25-7	And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.	Acts 25 : 7	Flowers_0001_2	bgc-0011
Acts-25-8	While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all.	Acts 25 : 8	Flowers_0001_3	bgc-0012

Acts-25-10	Then said Paul, I stand at Caesarâ€™s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.	Acts 25 : 10	Flowers_0001_5	bgc-0014
Acts-25-11	For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.	Acts 25 : 11	Flowers_0001_6	bgc-0015
Acts-25-12	Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.	Acts 25 : 12	Flowers_0001_7	bgc-0016

Acts-25-14	And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paulâ€™s cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix:	Acts 25 : 14	Flowers_0001_9	bgc-0004
Acts-25-15	About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed <i>me</i>, desiring <i>to have</i> judgment against him.	Acts 25 : 15	Flowers_0001_10	bgc-0005
Acts-25-16	To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.	Acts 25 : 16	Flowers_0001_11	bgc-0006
Acts-25-17	Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.	Acts 25 : 17	Flowers_0001_12	bgc-0007
Acts-25-18	Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:	Acts 25 : 18	Flowers_0001_13	bgc-0008
Acts-25-19	But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.	Acts 25 : 19	Flowers_0001_14	bgc-0009
Acts-25-20	And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked <i>him</i> whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.	Acts 25 : 20	Flowers_0001_15	bgc-0010
Acts-25-21	But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.	Acts 25 : 21	Flowers_0001_16	bgc-0011
Acts-25-22	Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.	Acts 25 : 22	Flowers_0001_17	bgc-0012
Acts-25-23	And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festusâ€™ commandment Paul was brought forth.	Acts 25 : 23	Flowers_0001_18	bgc-0013
Acts-25-24	And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and <i>also</i> here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.	Acts 25 : 24	Flowers_0001_19	bgc-0014
Acts-25-25	But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.	Acts 25 : 25	Flowers_0001_20	bgc-0015
Acts-25-26	Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.	Acts 25 : 26	Flowers_0001_21	bgc-0016
Acts-25-27	For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes <i>laid</i> against him.	Acts 25 : 27	Flowers_0001_22	bgc-0003
Acts-26-1	Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:	Acts 26 : 1	Flowers_0001_23	bgc-0004
Acts-26-2	I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews:	Acts 26 : 2	Flowers_0001_24	bgc-0005
Acts-26-3	Especially <i>because I know</i> thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.	Acts 26 : 3	Flowers_0001_25	bgc-0006
Acts-26-4	My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;	Acts 26 : 4	Flowers_0001_26	bgc-0007
Acts-26-5	Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.	Acts 26 : 5	Flowers_0001_27	bgc-0008
Acts-26-6	And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:	Acts 26 : 6	Flowers_0001_28	bgc-0009
Acts-26-7	Unto which <i>promise</i> our twelve tribes, instantly serving <i>God</i> day and night, hope to come. For which hopeâ€™s sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.	Acts 26 : 7	Flowers_0001_29	bgc-0010
Acts-26-8	Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?	Acts 26 : 8	Flowers_0001_30	bgc-0011
Acts-26-9	I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.	Acts 26 : 9	Flowers_0001_31	bgc-0012
Acts-26-10	Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against <i>them</i>.	Acts 26 : 10	Flowers_0001_32	bgc-0013
Acts-26-11	And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled <i>them</i> to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted <i>them</i> even unto strange cities.	Acts 26 : 11	Flowers_0001_33	bgc-0014

Acts-26-13	At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.	Acts 26 : 13	Flowers_0001_35	bgc-0016
Acts-26-14	And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? <i>it is</i> hard for thee to kick against the pricks.	Acts 26 : 14	Flowers_0001_36	bgc-0003
Acts-26-15	And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.	Acts 26 : 15	Flowers_0001_37	bgc-0004
Acts-26-16	But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will appear unto thee;	Acts 26 : 16	Flowers_0001_38	bgc-0005
Acts-26-17	Delivering thee from the people, and <i>from</i> the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,	Acts 26 : 17	Flowers_0001_39	bgc-0006
Acts-26-18	To open their eyes, <i>and</i> to turn <i>them</i> from darkness to light, and <i>from</i> the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.	Acts 26 : 18	Flowers_0001_40	bgc-0007
Acts-26-19	Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:	Acts 26 : 19	Flowers_0001_41	bgc-0008
Acts-26-20	But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and <i>then</i> to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.	Acts 26 : 20	Flowers_0001_42	bgc-0009
Acts-26-21	For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill <i>me</i>.	Acts 26 : 21	Flowers_0001_43	bgc-0010
Acts-26-22	Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:	Acts 26 : 22	Flowers_0001_44	bgc-0011
Acts-26-23	That Christ should suffer, <i>and</i> that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.	Acts 26 : 23	Flowers_0001_45	bgc-0012
Acts-26-24	And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.	Acts 26 : 24	Flowers_0001_46	bgc-0013
Acts-26-25	But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness.	Acts 26 : 25	Flowers_0001_47	bgc-0014
Acts-26-26	For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.	Acts 26 : 26	Flowers_0001_48	bgc-0015
Acts-26-27	King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.	Acts 26 : 27	Flowers_0001_49	bgc-0016
Acts-26-28	Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.	Acts 26 : 28	Flowers_0001_50	bgc-0003
Acts-26-29	And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds.	Acts 26 : 29	Flowers_0001_51	bgc-0004
Acts-26-30	And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:	Acts 26 : 30	Flowers_0001_52	bgc-0005
Acts-26-31	And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.	Acts 26 : 31	Flowers_0001_53	bgc-0006
Acts-26-32	Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.	Acts 26 : 32	Flowers_0001_54	bgc-0007
Acts-27-1	And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto <i>one</i> named Julius, a centurion of Augustusâ€™ band.	Acts 27 : 1	Flowers_0001_55	bgc-0008
Acts-27-2	And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; <i>one</i> Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.	Acts 27 : 2	Flowers_0001_56	bgc-0009
Acts-27-3	And the next <i>day</i> we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave <i>him</i> liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.	Acts 27 : 3	Flowers_0001_57	bgc-0010
Acts-27-4	And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.	Acts 27 : 4	Flowers_0001_58	bgc-0011
Acts-27-5	And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, <i>a city</i> of Lycia.	Acts 27 : 5	Flowers_0001_59	bgc-0012
Acts-27-6	And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.	Acts 27 : 6	Flowers_0001_60	bgc-0013
Acts-27-7	And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;	Acts 27 : 7	Flowers_0001_61	bgc-0014
Acts-27-8	And, hardly passing it, came unto a place which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city <i>of</i> Lasea.	Acts 27 : 8	Flowers_0001_62	bgc-0015
Acts-27-9	Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished <i>them</i>,	Acts 27 : 9	Flowers_0001_63	bgc-0016
Acts-27-10	And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.	Acts 27 : 10	Flowers_0001_64	bgc-0003
Acts-27-11	Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.	Acts 27 : 11	Flowers_0001_65	bgc-0004
Acts-27-12	And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice, <i>and there</i> to winter; <i>which is</i> an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the south west and north west.	Acts 27 : 12	Flowers_0001_66	bgc-0005
Acts-27-13	And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained <i>their</i> purpose, loosing <i>thence</i>, they sailed close by Crete.	Acts 27 : 13	Flowers_0001_67	bgc-0006
Acts-27-14	But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.	Acts 27 : 14	Flowers_0001_68	bgc-0007
Acts-27-15	And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let <i>her</i> drive.	Acts 27 : 15	Flowers_0001_69	bgc-0008
Acts-27-16	And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:	Acts 27 : 16	Flowers_0001_70	bgc-0009
Acts-27-17	Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.	Acts 27 : 17	Flowers_0001_71	bgc-0010
Acts-27-18	And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next <i>day</i> they lightened the ship;	Acts 27 : 18	Flowers_0001_72	bgc-0011
Acts-27-19	And the third <i>day</i> we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship.	Acts 27 : 19	Flowers_0001_73	bgc-0012
Acts-27-20	And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on <i>us</i>, all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.	Acts 27 : 20	Flowers_0001_74	bgc-0013
Acts-27-21	But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.	Acts 27 : 21	Flowers_0001_75	bgc-0014
Acts-27-22	And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of <i>any manâ€™s</i> life among you, but of the ship.	Acts 27 : 22	Flowers_0001_76	bgc-0015
Acts-27-23	For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,	Acts 27 : 23	Flowers_0001_77	bgc-0016
Acts-27-24	Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.	Acts 27 : 24	Flowers_0001_78	bgc-0003
Acts-27-25	Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.	Acts 27 : 25	Flowers_0001_79	bgc-0004
Acts-27-26	Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.	Acts 27 : 26	Flowers_0001_80	bgc-0005
Acts-27-27	But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;	Acts 27 : 27	Flowers_0001_81	bgc-0006
Acts-27-28	And sounded, and found <i>it</i> twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found <i>it</i> fifteen fathoms.	Acts 27 : 28	Flowers_0001_82	bgc-0007
Acts-27-29	Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.	Acts 27 : 29	Flowers_0001_83	bgc-0008
Acts-27-30	And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,	Acts 27 : 30	Flowers_0001_84	bgc-0009
Acts-27-31	Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.	Acts 27 : 31	Flowers_0001_85	bgc-0010
Acts-27-32	Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.	Acts 27 : 32	Flowers_0001_86	bgc-0011
Acts-27-33	And while the day was coming on, Paul besought <i>them</i> all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.	Acts 27 : 33	Flowers_0001_87	bgc-0012
Acts-27-34	Wherefore I pray you to take <i>some</i> meat: for this is for your health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.	Acts 27 : 34	Flowers_0001_88	bgc-0013
Acts-27-35	And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken <i>it</i>, he began to eat.	Acts 27 : 35	Flowers_0001_89	bgc-0014
Acts-27-36	Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took <i>some</i> meat.	Acts 27 : 36	Flowers_0001_90	bgc-0015
Acts-27-37	And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.	Acts 27 : 37	Flowers_0001_91	bgc-0016
Acts-27-38	And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.	Acts 27 : 38	Flowers_0001_92	bgc-0003
Acts-27-39	And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.	Acts 27 : 39	Flowers_0001_93	bgc-0004
Acts-27-40	And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed <i>themselves</i> unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.	Acts 27 : 40	Flowers_0001_94	bgc-0005
Acts-27-41	And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.	Acts 27 : 41	Flowers_0001_95	bgc-0006
Acts-27-42	And the soldiersâ€™ counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.	Acts 27 : 42	Flowers_0001_96	bgc-0007
Acts-27-43	But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from <i>their</i> purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast <i>themselves</i> first <i>into the sea</i>, and get to land:	Acts 27 : 43	Flowers_0001_97	bgc-0008
Acts-27-44	And the rest, some on boards, and some on <i>broken pieces</i> of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.	Acts 27 : 44	Flowers_0001_98	bgc-0009
Acts-28-1	And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.	Acts 28 : 1	Flowers_0001_99	bgc-0010
Acts-28-2	And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.	Acts 28 : 2	Flowers_0001_100	bgc-0011
Acts-28-3	And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid <i>them</i> on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.	Acts 28 : 3	Flowers_0001_101	bgc-0012
Acts-28-4	And when the barbarians saw the <i>venomous</i> beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.	Acts 28 : 4	Flowers_0001_102	bgc-0013
Acts-28-5	And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.	Acts 28 : 5	Flowers_0001_103	bgc-0014
Acts-28-6	Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.	Acts 28 : 6	Flowers_0001_104	bgc-0015
Acts-28-7	In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.	Acts 28 : 7	Flowers_0001_105	bgc-0016
Acts-28-8	And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.	Acts 28 : 8	Flowers_0001_106	bgc-0003
Acts-28-9	So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:	Acts 28 : 9	Flowers_0001_107	bgc-0004
Acts-28-10	Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded <i>us</i> with such things as were necessary.	Acts 28 : 10	Flowers_0001_108	bgc-0005
Acts-28-11	And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.	Acts 28 : 11	Flowers_0001_109	bgc-0006
Acts-28-12	And landing at Syracuse, we tarried <i>there</i> three days.	Acts 28 : 12	Flowers_0001_110	bgc-0007
Acts-28-13	And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:	Acts 28 : 13	Flowers_0001_111	bgc-0008
Acts-28-14	Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.	Acts 28 : 14	Flowers_0001_112	bgc-0009
Acts-28-15	And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.	Acts 28 : 15	Flowers_0001_113	bgc-0010
Acts-28-16	And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.	Acts 28 : 16	Flowers_0001_114	bgc-0011
Acts-28-17	And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men <i>and</i> brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.	Acts 28 : 17	Flowers_0001_115	bgc-0012
Acts-28-18	Who, when they had examined me, would have let <i>me</i> go, because there was no cause of death in me.	Acts 28 : 18	Flowers_0001_116	bgc-0013
Acts-28-19	But when the Jews spake against <i>it</i>, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.	Acts 28 : 19	Flowers_0001_117	bgc-0014
Acts-28-20	For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see <i>you</i>, and to speak with <i>you</i>: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.	Acts 28 : 20	Flowers_0001_118	bgc-0015
Acts-28-21	And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.	Acts 28 : 21	Flowers_0001_119	bgc-0016
Acts-28-22	But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.	Acts 28 : 22	Flowers_0001_120	bgc-0003
Acts-28-23	And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into <i>his</i> lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and <i>out of</i> the prophets, from morning till evening.	Acts 28 : 23	Flowers_0001_121	bgc-0004
Acts-28-24	And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.	Acts 28 : 24	Flowers_0001_122	bgc-0005
Acts-28-25	And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,	Acts 28 : 25	Flowers_0001_123	bgc-0006
Acts-28-26	Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:	Acts 28 : 26	Flowers_0001_124	bgc-0007
Acts-28-27	For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with <i>their</i> eyes, and hear with <i>their</i> ears, and understand with <i>their</i> heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.	Acts 28 : 27	Flowers_0001_125	bgc-0008
Acts-28-28	Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and <i>that</i> they will hear it.	Acts 28 : 28	Flowers_0001_126	bgc-0009
Acts-28-29	And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.	Acts 28 : 29	Flowers_0001_127	bgc-0010
Acts-28-30	And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,	Acts 28 : 30	Flowers_0001_128	bgc-0011
Acts-28-31	Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.	Acts 28 : 31	Flowers_0001_129	bgc-0012
Romans-1-1	Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called <i>to be</i> an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,	Romans 1 : 1	Flowers_0001_130	bgc-0013
Romans-1-2	(Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)	Romans 1 : 2	Flowers_0001_131	bgc-0014
Romans-1-3	Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;	Romans 1 : 3	Flowers_0001_132	bgc-0015
Romans-1-4	And declared <i>to be</i> the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:	Romans 1 : 4	Flowers_0001_133	bgc-0016
Romans-1-5	By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:	Romans 1 : 5	Flowers_0001_134	bgc-0003
Romans-1-6	Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:	Romans 1 : 6	Flowers_0001_135	bgc-0004
Romans-1-7	To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called <i>to be</i> saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.	Romans 1 : 7	Flowers_0001_136	bgc-0005
Romans-1-8	First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.	Romans 1 : 8	Flowers_0001_137	bgc-0006
Romans-1-9	For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;	Romans 1 : 9	Flowers_0001_138	bgc-0007
Romans-1-10	Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.	Romans 1 : 10	Flowers_0001_139	bgc-0008
Romans-1-11	For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;	Romans 1 : 11	Flowers_0001_140	bgc-0009
Romans-1-12	That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.	Romans 1 : 12	Flowers_0001_141	bgc-0010
Romans-1-13	Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.	Romans 1 : 13	Flowers_0001_142	bgc-0011
Romans-1-14	I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.	Romans 1 : 14	Flowers_0001_143	bgc-0012
Romans-1-15	So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.	Romans 1 : 15	Flowers_0001_144	bgc-0013
Romans-1-16	For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.	Romans 1 : 16	Flowers_0001_145	bgc-0014
Romans-1-17	For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.	Romans 1 : 17	Flowers_0001_146	bgc-0015
Romans-1-18	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;	Romans 1 : 18	Flowers_0001_147	bgc-0016
Romans-1-19	Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed <i>it</i> unto them.	Romans 1 : 19	Flowers_0001_148	bgc-0003
Romans-1-20	For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, <i>even</i> his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:	Romans 1 : 20	Flowers_0001_149	bgc-0004
Romans-1-21	Because that, when they knew God, they glorified <i>him</i> not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.	Romans 1 : 21	Flowers_0001_150	bgc-0005
Romans-1-22	Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,	Romans 1 : 22	Flowers_0001_151	bgc-0006
Romans-1-23	And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.	Romans 1 : 23	Flowers_0001_152	bgc-0007
Romans-1-24	Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:	Romans 1 : 24	Flowers_0001_153	bgc-0008
Romans-1-25	Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen.	Romans 1 : 25	Flowers_0001_154	bgc-0009
Romans-1-26	For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:	Romans 1 : 26	Flowers_0001_155	bgc-0010
Romans-1-27	And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.	Romans 1 : 27	Flowers_0001_156	bgc-0011
Romans-1-28	And even as they did not like to retain God in <i>their</i> knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;	Romans 1 : 28	Flowers_0001_157	bgc-0012
Romans-1-29	Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,	Romans 1 : 29	Flowers_0001_158	bgc-0013
Romans-1-30	Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,	Romans 1 : 30	Flowers_0001_159	bgc-0014
Romans-1-31	Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:	Romans 1 : 31	Flowers_0001_160	bgc-0015
Romans-1-32	Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.	Romans 1 : 32	Flowers_0001_161	bgc-0016
Romans-2-1	Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things.	Romans 2 : 1	Flowers_0001_162	bgc-0003
Romans-2-2	But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth against them which commit such things.	Romans 2 : 2	Flowers_0001_163	bgc-0004
Romans-2-3	And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?	Romans 2 : 3	Flowers_0001_164	bgc-0005
Romans-2-4	Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?	Romans 2 : 4	Flowers_0001_165	bgc-0006
Romans-2-5	But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;	Romans 2 : 5	Flowers_0001_166	bgc-0007
Romans-2-6	Who will render to every man according to his deeds:	Romans 2 : 6	Flowers_0001_167	bgc-0008
Romans-2-7	To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:	Romans 2 : 7	Flowers_0001_168	bgc-0009
Romans-2-8	But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,	Romans 2 : 8	Flowers_0001_169	bgc-0010
Romans-2-9	Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;	Romans 2 : 9	Flowers_0001_170	bgc-0011
Romans-2-10	But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:	Romans 2 : 10	Flowers_0001_171	bgc-0012
Romans-2-11	For there is no respect of persons with God.	Romans 2 : 11	Flowers_0001_172	bgc-0013
Romans-2-12	For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;	Romans 2 : 12	Flowers_0001_173	bgc-0014
Romans-2-13	For not the hearers of the law <i>are</i> just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.	Romans 2 : 13	Flowers_0001_174	bgc-0015
Romans-2-14	For when the Gentiles, which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these, having not the law, are a law unto themselves:	Romans 2 : 14	Flowers_0001_175	bgc-0016
Romans-2-15	Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and <i>their</i> thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;	Romans 2 : 15	Flowers_0001_176	bgc-0003
Romans-2-16	In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.	Romans 2 : 16	Flowers_0001_177	bgc-0004
Romans-2-17	Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,	Romans 2 : 17	Flowers_0001_178	bgc-0005
Romans-2-18	And knowest <i>his</i> will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;	Romans 2 : 18	Flowers_0001_179	bgc-0006
Romans-2-19	And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,	Romans 2 : 19	Flowers_0001_180	bgc-0007
Romans-2-20	An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.	Romans 2 : 20	Flowers_0001_181	bgc-0008
Romans-2-21	Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?	Romans 2 : 21	Flowers_0001_182	bgc-0009
Romans-2-22	Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?	Romans 2 : 22	Flowers_0001_183	bgc-0010
Romans-2-23	Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?	Romans 2 : 23	Flowers_0001_184	bgc-0011
Romans-2-24	For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.	Romans 2 : 24	Flowers_0001_185	bgc-0012
Romans-2-25	For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keep the law: but if thou be a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.	Romans 2 : 25	Flowers_0001_186	bgc-0013
Romans-2-26	Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?	Romans 2 : 26	Flowers_0001_187	bgc-0014
Romans-2-27	And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?	Romans 2 : 27	Flowers_0001_188	bgc-0015
Romans-2-28	For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither <i>is that</i> circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:	Romans 2 : 28	Flowers_0001_189	bgc-0016
Romans-2-29	But he <i>is</i> a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision <i>is that</i> of the heart, in the spirit, <i>and</i> not in the letter; whose praise <i>is</i> not of men, but of God.	Romans 2 : 29	Flowers_0001_190	bgc-0003
Romans-3-1	What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit <i>is there</i> of circumcision?	Romans 3 : 1	Flowers_0001_191	bgc-0004
Romans-3-2	Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.	Romans 3 : 2	Flowers_0001_192	bgc-0005
Romans-3-3	For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?	Romans 3 : 3	Flowers_0001_193	bgc-0006
Romans-3-4	God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.	Romans 3 : 4	Flowers_0001_194	bgc-0007
Romans-3-5	But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? <i>Is</i> God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)	Romans 3 : 5	Flowers_0001_195	bgc-0008
Romans-3-6	God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?	Romans 3 : 6	Flowers_0001_196	bgc-0009
Romans-3-7	For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?	Romans 3 : 7	Flowers_0001_197	bgc-0010
Romans-3-8	And not <i>rather</i>, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.	Romans 3 : 8	Flowers_0001_198	bgc-0011
Romans-3-9	What then? are we better <i>than they</i>? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;	Romans 3 : 9	Flowers_0001_199	bgc-0012
Romans-3-10	As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:	Romans 3 : 10	Flowers_0001_200	bgc-0013
Romans-3-11	There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.	Romans 3 : 11	Flowers_0001_201	bgc-0014
Romans-3-12	They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.	Romans 3 : 12	Flowers_0001_202	bgc-0015
Romans-3-13	Their throat <i>is</i> an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps <i>is</i> under their lips:	Romans 3 : 13	Flowers_0001_203	bgc-0016
Romans-3-14	Whose mouth <i>is</i> full of cursing and bitterness:	Romans 3 : 14	Flowers_0001_204	bgc-0003
Romans-3-15	Their feet <i>are</i> swift to shed blood:	Romans 3 : 15	Flowers_0001_205	bgc-0004
Romans-3-16	Destruction and misery <i>are</i> in their ways:	Romans 3 : 16	Flowers_0001_206	bgc-0005
Romans-3-17	And the way of peace have they not known:	Romans 3 : 17	Flowers_0001_207	bgc-0006
Romans-3-18	There is no fear of God before their eyes.	Romans 3 : 18	Flowers_0001_208	bgc-0007
Romans-3-19	Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.	Romans 3 : 19	Flowers_0001_209	bgc-0008
Romans-3-20	Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law <i>is</i> the knowledge of sin.	Romans 3 : 20	Flowers_0001_210	bgc-0009
Romans-3-21	But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;	Romans 3 : 21	Flowers_0001_211	bgc-0010
Romans-3-22	Even the righteousness of God <i>which is</i> by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:	Romans 3 : 22	Flowers_0001_212	bgc-0011
Romans-3-23	For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;	Romans 3 : 23	Flowers_0001_213	bgc-0012
Romans-3-24	Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:	Romans 3 : 24	Flowers_0001_214	bgc-0013
Romans-3-25	Whom God hath set forth <i>to be</i> a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;	Romans 3 : 25	Flowers_0001_215	bgc-0014
Romans-3-26	To declare, <i>I say</i>, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.	Romans 3 : 26	Flowers_0001_216	bgc-0015
Romans-3-27	Where <i>is</i> boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.	Romans 3 : 27	Flowers_0001_217	bgc-0016
Romans-3-28	Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.	Romans 3 : 28	Flowers_0001_218	bgc-0003
Romans-3-29	<i>Is he</i> the God of the Jews only? <i>is he</i> not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:	Romans 3 : 29	Flowers_0001_219	bgc-0004
Romans-3-30	Seeing <i>it is</i> one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.	Romans 3 : 30	Flowers_0001_220	bgc-0005
Romans-3-31	Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.	Romans 3 : 31	Flowers_0001_221	bgc-0006
Romans-4-1	What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?	Romans 4 : 1	Flowers_0001_222	bgc-0007
Romans-4-2	For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath <i>whereof</i> to glory; but not before God.	Romans 4 : 2	Flowers_0001_223	bgc-0008
Romans-4-3	For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.	Romans 4 : 3	Flowers_0001_224	bgc-0009
Romans-4-4	Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.	Romans 4 : 4	Flowers_0001_225	bgc-0010
Romans-4-5	But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.	Romans 4 : 5	Flowers_0001_226	bgc-0011
Romans-4-6	Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,	Romans 4 : 6	Flowers_0001_227	bgc-0012
Romans-4-7	<i>Saying</i>, Blessed <i>are</i> they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.	Romans 4 : 7	Flowers_0001_228	bgc-0013
Romans-4-8	Blessed <i>is</i> the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.	Romans 4 : 8	Flowers_0001_229	bgc-0014
Romans-4-9	<i>Cometh</i> this blessedness then upon the circumcision <i>only</i>, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.	Romans 4 : 9	Flowers_0001_230	bgc-0015
Romans-4-10	How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.	Romans 4 : 10	Flowers_0001_231	bgc-0016
Romans-4-11	And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which <i>he had yet</i> being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:	Romans 4 : 11	Flowers_0001_232	bgc-0003
Romans-4-12	And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which <i>he had</i> being <i>yet</i> uncircumcised.	Romans 4 : 12	Flowers_0001_233	bgc-0004
Romans-4-13	For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, <i>was</i> not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.	Romans 4 : 13	Flowers_0001_234	bgc-0005
Romans-4-14	For if they which are of the law <i>be</i> heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:	Romans 4 : 14	Flowers_0001_235	bgc-0006
Romans-4-15	Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, <i>there is</i> no transgression.	Romans 4 : 15	Flowers_0001_236	bgc-0007
Romans-4-16	Therefore <i>it is</i> of faith, that <i>it might be</i> by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,	Romans 4 : 16	Flowers_0001_237	bgc-0008
Romans-4-17	(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, <i>even</i> God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.	Romans 4 : 17	Flowers_0001_238	bgc-0009
Romans-4-18	Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations; according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.	Romans 4 : 18	Flowers_0001_239	bgc-0010
Romans-4-19	And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Saraâ€™s womb:	Romans 4 : 19	Flowers_0001_240	bgc-0011
Romans-4-20	He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;	Romans 4 : 20	Flowers_0001_241	bgc-0012
Romans-4-21	And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.	Romans 4 : 21	Flowers_0001_242	bgc-0013
Romans-4-22	And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.	Romans 4 : 22	Flowers_0001_243	bgc-0014
Romans-4-23	Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;	Romans 4 : 23	Flowers_0001_244	bgc-0015
Romans-4-24	But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;	Romans 4 : 24	Flowers_0001_245	bgc-0016
Romans-4-25	Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.	Romans 4 : 25	Flowers_0001_246	bgc-0003
Romans-5-1	Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:	Romans 5 : 1	Flowers_0001_247	bgc-0004
Romans-5-2	By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.	Romans 5 : 2	Flowers_0001_248	bgc-0005
Romans-5-3	And not only <i>so</i>, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;	Romans 5 : 3	Flowers_0001_249	bgc-0006
Romans-5-4	And patience, experience; and experience, hope:	Romans 5 : 4	Flowers_0001_250	bgc-0007
Romans-5-5	And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.	Romans 5 : 5	Flowers_0001_251	bgc-0008
Romans-5-6	For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.	Romans 5 : 6	Flowers_0001_252	bgc-0009
Romans-5-7	For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.	Romans 5 : 7	Flowers_0001_253	bgc-0010
Romans-5-8	But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.	Romans 5 : 8	Flowers_0001_254	bgc-0011
Romans-5-9	Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.	Romans 5 : 9	Flowers_0001_255	bgc-0012
Romans-5-10	For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.	Romans 5 : 10	Flowers_0001_256	bgc-0013
Romans-5-11	And not only <i>so</i>, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.	Romans 5 : 11	Flowers_0001_257	bgc-0014
Romans-5-12	Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:	Romans 5 : 12	Flowers_0001_258	bgc-0015
Romans-5-13	For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.	Romans 5 : 13	Flowers_0001_259	bgc-0016
Romans-5-14	Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adamâ€™s transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.	Romans 5 : 14	Flowers_0001_260	bgc-0003
Romans-5-15	But not as the offence, so also <i>is</i> the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, <i>which is</i> by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.	Romans 5 : 15	Flowers_0001_261	bgc-0004
Romans-5-16	And not as <i>it was</i> by one that sinned, <i>so is</i> the gift: for the judgment <i>was</i> by one to condemnation, but the free gift <i>is</i> of many offences unto justification.	Romans 5 : 16	Flowers_0001_262	bgc-0005
Romans-5-17	For if by one manâ€™s offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.	Romans 5 : 17	Flowers_0001_263	bgc-0006
Romans-5-18	Therefore as by the offence of one <i>judgment came</i> upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one <i>the free gift came</i> upon all men unto justification of life.	Romans 5 : 18	Flowers_0001_264	bgc-0007
Romans-5-19	For as by one manâ€™s disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.	Romans 5 : 19	Flowers_0001_265	bgc-0008
Romans-5-20	Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:	Romans 5 : 20	Flowers_0001_266	bgc-0009
Romans-5-21	That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.	Romans 5 : 21	Flowers_0001_267	bgc-0010
Romans-6-1	What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?	Romans 6 : 1	Flowers_0001_268	bgc-0011
Romans-6-2	God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?	Romans 6 : 2	Flowers_0001_269	bgc-0012
Romans-6-3	Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?	Romans 6 : 3	Flowers_0001_270	bgc-0013
Romans-6-4	Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.	Romans 6 : 4	Flowers_0001_271	bgc-0014
Romans-6-5	For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also <i>in the likeness</i> of <i>his</i> resurrection:	Romans 6 : 5	Flowers_0001_272	bgc-0015
Romans-6-6	Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with <i>him</i>, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.	Romans 6 : 6	Flowers_0001_273	bgc-0016
Romans-6-7	For he that is dead is freed from sin.	Romans 6 : 7	Flowers_0001_274	bgc-0003
Romans-6-8	Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:	Romans 6 : 8	Flowers_0001_275	bgc-0004
Romans-6-9	Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.	Romans 6 : 9	Flowers_0001_276	bgc-0005
Romans-6-10	For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.	Romans 6 : 10	Flowers_0001_277	bgc-0006
Romans-6-11	Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.	Romans 6 : 11	Flowers_0001_278	bgc-0007
Romans-6-12	Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.	Romans 6 : 12	Flowers_0001_279	bgc-0008
Romans-6-13	Neither yield ye your members <i>as</i> instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members <i>as</i> instruments of righteousness unto God.	Romans 6 : 13	Flowers_0001_280	bgc-0009
Romans-6-14	For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.	Romans 6 : 14	Flowers_0001_281	bgc-0010
Romans-6-15	What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.	Romans 6 : 15	Flowers_0001_282	bgc-0011
Romans-6-16	Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?	Romans 6 : 16	Flowers_0001_283	bgc-0012
Romans-6-17	But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.	Romans 6 : 17	Flowers_0001_284	bgc-0013
Romans-6-18	Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.	Romans 6 : 18	Flowers_0001_285	bgc-0014
Romans-6-19	I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.	Romans 6 : 19	Flowers_0001_286	bgc-0015
Romans-6-20	For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.	Romans 6 : 20	Flowers_0001_287	bgc-0016
Romans-6-21	What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things <i>is</i> death.	Romans 6 : 21	Flowers_0001_288	bgc-0003
Romans-6-22	But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.	Romans 6 : 22	Flowers_0001_289	bgc-0004
Romans-6-23	For the wages of sin <i>is</i> death; but the gift of God <i>is</i> eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.	Romans 6 : 23	Flowers_0001_290	bgc-0005
Romans-7-1	Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?	Romans 7 : 1	Flowers_0001_291	bgc-0006
Romans-7-2	For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to <i>her</i> husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of <i>her</i> husband.	Romans 7 : 2	Flowers_0001_292	bgc-0007
Romans-7-3	So then if, while <i>her</i> husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.	Romans 7 : 3	Flowers_0001_293	bgc-0008
Romans-7-4	Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, <i>even</i> to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.	Romans 7 : 4	Flowers_0001_294	bgc-0009
Romans-7-5	For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.	Romans 7 : 5	Flowers_0001_295	bgc-0010
Romans-7-6	But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not <i>in</i> the oldness of the letter.	Romans 7 : 6	Flowers_0001_296	bgc-0011
Romans-7-7	What shall we say then? <i>Is</i> the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.	Romans 7 : 7	Flowers_0001_297	bgc-0012
Romans-7-8	But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin <i>was</i> dead.	Romans 7 : 8	Flowers_0001_298	bgc-0013
Romans-7-9	For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.	Romans 7 : 9	Flowers_0001_299	bgc-0014
Romans-7-10	And the commandment, which <i>was ordained</i> to life, I found <i>to be</i> unto death.	Romans 7 : 10	Flowers_0001_300	bgc-0015
Romans-7-11	For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew <i>me</i>.	Romans 7 : 11	Flowers_0001_301	bgc-0016
Romans-7-12	Wherefore the law <i>is</i> holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.	Romans 7 : 12	Flowers_0001_302	bgc-0003
Romans-7-13	Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.	Romans 7 : 13	Flowers_0001_303	bgc-0004
Romans-7-14	For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.	Romans 7 : 14	Flowers_0001_304	bgc-0005
Romans-7-15	For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.	Romans 7 : 15	Flowers_0001_305	bgc-0006
Romans-7-16	If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that <i>it is</i> good.	Romans 7 : 16	Flowers_0001_306	bgc-0007
Romans-7-17	Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.	Romans 7 : 17	Flowers_0001_307	bgc-0008
Romans-7-18	For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but <i>how</i> to perform that which is good I find not.	Romans 7 : 18	Flowers_0001_308	bgc-0009
Romans-7-19	For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.	Romans 7 : 19	Flowers_0001_309	bgc-0010
Romans-7-20	Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.	Romans 7 : 20	Flowers_0001_310	bgc-0011
Romans-7-21	I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.	Romans 7 : 21	Flowers_0001_311	bgc-0012
Romans-7-22	For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:	Romans 7 : 22	Flowers_0001_312	bgc-0013
Romans-7-23	But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.	Romans 7 : 23	Flowers_0001_313	bgc-0014
Romans-7-24	O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?	Romans 7 : 24	Flowers_0001_314	bgc-0015
Romans-7-25	I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.	Romans 7 : 25	Flowers_0001_315	bgc-0016
Romans-8-1	<i>There is</i> therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.	Romans 8 : 1	Flowers_0001_316	bgc-0003
Romans-8-2	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.	Romans 8 : 2	Flowers_0001_317	bgc-0004
Romans-8-3	For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:	Romans 8 : 3	Flowers_0001_318	bgc-0005
Romans-8-4	That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.	Romans 8 : 4	Flowers_0001_319	bgc-0006
Romans-8-5	For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.	Romans 8 : 5	Flowers_0001_320	bgc-0007
Romans-8-6	For to be carnally minded <i>is</i> death; but to be spiritually minded <i>is</i> life and peace.	Romans 8 : 6	Flowers_0001_321	bgc-0008
Romans-8-7	Because the carnal mind <i>is</i> enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.	Romans 8 : 7	Flowers_0001_322	bgc-0009
Romans-8-8	So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.	Romans 8 : 8	Flowers_0001_323	bgc-0010
Romans-8-9	But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.	Romans 8 : 9	Flowers_0001_324	bgc-0011
Romans-8-10	And if Christ <i>be</i> in you, the body <i>is</i> dead because of sin; but the Spirit <i>is</i> life because of righteousness.	Romans 8 : 10	Flowers_0001_325	bgc-0012
Romans-8-11	But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.	Romans 8 : 11	Flowers_0001_326	bgc-0013
Romans-8-12	Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.	Romans 8 : 12	Flowers_0001_327	bgc-0014
Romans-8-13	For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.	Romans 8 : 13	Flowers_0001_328	bgc-0015
Romans-8-14	For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.	Romans 8 : 14	Flowers_0001_329	bgc-0016
Romans-8-15	For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.	Romans 8 : 15	Flowers_0001_330	bgc-0003
Romans-8-16	The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:	Romans 8 : 16	Flowers_0001_331	bgc-0004
Romans-8-17	And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with <i>him</i>, that we may be also glorified together.	Romans 8 : 17	Flowers_0001_332	bgc-0005
Romans-8-18	For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time <i>are</i> not worthy <i>to be compared</i> with the glory which shall be revealed in us.	Romans 8 : 18	Flowers_0001_333	bgc-0006
Romans-8-19	For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.	Romans 8 : 19	Flowers_0001_334	bgc-0007
Romans-8-20	For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected <i>the same</i> in hope,	Romans 8 : 20	Flowers_0001_335	bgc-0008
Romans-8-21	Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.	Romans 8 : 21	Flowers_0001_336	bgc-0009
Romans-8-22	For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.	Romans 8 : 22	Flowers_0001_337	bgc-0010
Romans-8-23	And not only <i>they</i>, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, <i>to wit</i>, the redemption of our body.	Romans 8 : 23	Flowers_0001_338	bgc-0011
Romans-8-24	For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?	Romans 8 : 24	Flowers_0001_339	bgc-0012
Romans-8-25	But if we hope for that we see not, <i>then</i> do we with patience wait for <i>it</i>.	Romans 8 : 25	Flowers_0001_340	bgc-0013
Romans-8-26	Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.	Romans 8 : 26	Flowers_0001_341	bgc-0014
Romans-8-27	And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what <i>is</i> the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to <i>the will of</i> God.	Romans 8 : 27	Flowers_0001_342	bgc-0015
Romans-8-28	And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to <i>his</i> purpose.	Romans 8 : 28	Flowers_0001_343	bgc-0016
Romans-8-29	For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate <i>to be</i> conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.	Romans 8 : 29	Flowers_0001_1	bgc-0003
Romans-8-30	Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.	Romans 8 : 30	Flowers_0001_2	bgc-0004
Romans-8-31	What shall we then say to these things? If God <i>be</i> for us, who <i>can be</i> against us?	Romans 8 : 31	Flowers_0001_3	bgc-0005
Romans-8-32	He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?	Romans 8 : 32	Flowers_0001_4	bgc-0006
Romans-8-33	Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Godâ€™s elect? <i>It is</i> God that justifieth.	Romans 8 : 33	Flowers_0001_5	bgc-0007
Romans-8-34	Who <i>is</i> he that condemneth? <i>It is</i> Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.	Romans 8 : 34	Flowers_0001_6	bgc-0008
Romans-8-35	Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? <i>shall</i> tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?	Romans 8 : 35	Flowers_0001_7	bgc-0009
Romans-8-36	As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.	Romans 8 : 36	Flowers_0001_8	bgc-0010
Romans-8-37	Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.	Romans 8 : 37	Flowers_0001_9	bgc-0011
Romans-8-38	For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,	Romans 8 : 38	Flowers_0001_10	bgc-0012
Romans-8-39	Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.	Romans 8 : 39	Flowers_0001_11	bgc-0013
Romans-9-1	I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,	Romans 9 : 1	Flowers_0001_12	bgc-0014
Romans-9-2	That I have great heaviness and continual sorrow in my heart.	Romans 9 : 2	Flowers_0001_13	bgc-0015
Romans-9-3	For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:	Romans 9 : 3	Flowers_0001_14	bgc-0016
Romans-9-4	Who are Israelites; to whom <i>pertaineth</i> the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service <i>of God</i>, and the promises;	Romans 9 : 4	Flowers_0001_15	bgc-0003
Romans-9-5	Whose <i>are</i> the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh Christ <i>came</i>, who is over all, God blessed for ever. Amen.	Romans 9 : 5	Flowers_0001_16	bgc-0004
Romans-9-6	Not as though the word of God hath taken none effect. For they <i>are</i> not all Israel, which are of Israel:	Romans 9 : 6	Flowers_0001_17	bgc-0005
Romans-9-7	Neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, <i>are they</i> all children: but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.	Romans 9 : 7	Flowers_0001_18	bgc-0006
Romans-9-8	That is, They which are the children of the flesh, these <i>are</i> not the children of God: but the children of the promise are counted for the seed.	Romans 9 : 8	Flowers_0001_19	bgc-0007
Romans-9-9	For this <i>is</i> the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sara shall have a son.	Romans 9 : 9	Flowers_0001_20	bgc-0008
Romans-9-10	And not only <i>this</i>; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, <i>even</i> by our father Isaac;	Romans 9 : 10	Flowers_0001_21	bgc-0009
Romans-9-11	(For <i>the children</i> being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)	Romans 9 : 11	Flowers_0001_22	bgc-0010
Romans-9-12	It was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.	Romans 9 : 12	Flowers_0001_23	bgc-0011
Romans-9-13	As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.	Romans 9 : 13	Flowers_0001_24	bgc-0012
Romans-9-14	What shall we say then? <i>Is there</i> unrighteousness with God? God forbid.	Romans 9 : 14	Flowers_0001_25	bgc-0013
Romans-9-15	For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.	Romans 9 : 15	Flowers_0001_26	bgc-0014
Romans-9-16	So then <i>it is</i> not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.	Romans 9 : 16	Flowers_0001_27	bgc-0015
Romans-9-17	For the scripture saith unto Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might shew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.	Romans 9 : 17	Flowers_0001_28	bgc-0016
Romans-9-18	Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will <i>have mercy</i>, and whom he will he hardeneth.	Romans 9 : 18	Flowers_0001_29	bgc-0003
Romans-9-19	Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?	Romans 9 : 19	Flowers_0001_30	bgc-0004
Romans-9-20	Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed <i>it</i>, Why hast thou made me thus?	Romans 9 : 20	Flowers_0001_31	bgc-0005
Romans-9-21	Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?	Romans 9 : 21	Flowers_0001_32	bgc-0006
Romans-9-22	<i>What</i> if God, willing to shew <i>his</i> wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath fitted to destruction:	Romans 9 : 22	Flowers_0001_33	bgc-0007
Romans-9-23	And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory,	Romans 9 : 23	Flowers_0001_34	bgc-0008
Romans-9-24	Even us, whom he hath called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles?	Romans 9 : 24	Flowers_0001_35	bgc-0009
Romans-9-25	As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved.	Romans 9 : 25	Flowers_0001_36	bgc-0010
Romans-9-26	And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> in the place where it was said unto them, Ye <i>are</i> not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.	Romans 9 : 26	Flowers_0001_37	bgc-0011
Romans-9-27	Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:	Romans 9 : 27	Flowers_0001_38	bgc-0012
Romans-9-28	For he will finish the work, and cut <i>it</i> short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth.	Romans 9 : 28	Flowers_0001_39	bgc-0013
Romans-9-29	And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha.	Romans 9 : 29	Flowers_0001_40	bgc-0014
Romans-9-30	What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.	Romans 9 : 30	Flowers_0001_41	bgc-0015
Romans-9-31	But Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, hath not attained to the law of righteousness.	Romans 9 : 31	Flowers_0001_42	bgc-0016
Romans-9-32	Wherefore? Because <i>they sought it</i> not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stumblingstone;	Romans 9 : 32	Flowers_0001_43	bgc-0003
Romans-9-33	As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.	Romans 9 : 33	Flowers_0001_44	bgc-0004
Romans-10-1	Brethren, my heartâ€™s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved.	Romans 10 : 1	Flowers_0001_45	bgc-0005
Romans-10-2	For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.	Romans 10 : 2	Flowers_0001_46	bgc-0006
Romans-10-3	For they being ignorant of Godâ€™s righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.	Romans 10 : 3	Flowers_0001_47	bgc-0007
Romans-10-4	For Christ <i>is</i> the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.	Romans 10 : 4	Flowers_0001_48	bgc-0008
Romans-10-5	For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them.	Romans 10 : 5	Flowers_0001_49	bgc-0009
Romans-10-6	But the righteousness which is of faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down <i>from above</i>:)	Romans 10 : 6	Flowers_0001_50	bgc-0010
Romans-10-7	Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring up Christ again from the dead.)	Romans 10 : 7	Flowers_0001_51	bgc-0011
Romans-10-8	But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, <i>even</i> in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;	Romans 10 : 8	Flowers_0001_52	bgc-0012
Romans-10-9	That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.	Romans 10 : 9	Flowers_0001_53	bgc-0013
Romans-10-10	For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.	Romans 10 : 10	Flowers_0001_54	bgc-0014
Romans-10-11	For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.	Romans 10 : 11	Flowers_0001_55	bgc-0015
Romans-10-12	For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.	Romans 10 : 12	Flowers_0001_56	bgc-0016
Romans-10-13	For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.	Romans 10 : 13	Flowers_0001_57	bgc-0003
Romans-10-14	How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?	Romans 10 : 14	Flowers_0001_58	bgc-0004
Romans-10-15	And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!	Romans 10 : 15	Flowers_0001_59	bgc-0005
Romans-10-16	But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Esaias saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?	Romans 10 : 16	Flowers_0001_60	bgc-0006
Romans-10-17	So then faith <i>cometh</i> by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.	Romans 10 : 17	Flowers_0001_61	bgc-0007
Romans-10-18	But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.	Romans 10 : 18	Flowers_0001_62	bgc-0008
Romans-10-19	But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by <i>them that are</i> no people, <i>and</i> by a foolish nation I will anger you.	Romans 10 : 19	Flowers_0001_63	bgc-0009
Romans-10-20	But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me.	Romans 10 : 20	Flowers_0001_64	bgc-0010
Romans-10-21	But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.	Romans 10 : 21	Flowers_0001_65	bgc-0011
Romans-11-1	I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, <i>of</i> the tribe of Benjamin.	Romans 11 : 1	Flowers_0001_66	bgc-0012
Romans-11-2	God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,	Romans 11 : 2	Flowers_0001_67	bgc-0013
Romans-11-3	Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.	Romans 11 : 3	Flowers_0001_68	bgc-0014
Romans-11-4	But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to <i>the image of</i> Baal.	Romans 11 : 4	Flowers_0001_69	bgc-0015
Romans-11-5	Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.	Romans 11 : 5	Flowers_0001_70	bgc-0016
Romans-11-6	And if by grace, then <i>is it</i> no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if <i>it be</i> of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.	Romans 11 : 6	Flowers_0001_71	bgc-0003
Romans-11-7	What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded	Romans 11 : 7	Flowers_0001_72	bgc-0004
Romans-11-8	(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.	Romans 11 : 8	Flowers_0001_73	bgc-0005
Romans-11-9	And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:	Romans 11 : 9	Flowers_0001_74	bgc-0006
Romans-11-10	Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.	Romans 11 : 10	Flowers_0001_75	bgc-0007
Romans-11-11	I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but <i>rather</i> through their fall salvation <i>is come</i> unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.	Romans 11 : 11	Flowers_0001_76	bgc-0008
Romans-11-12	Now if the fall of them <i>be</i> the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?	Romans 11 : 12	Flowers_0001_77	bgc-0009
Romans-11-13	For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:	Romans 11 : 13	Flowers_0001_78	bgc-0010
Romans-11-14	If by any means I may provoke to emulation <i>them which are</i> my flesh, and might save some of them.	Romans 11 : 14	Flowers_0001_79	bgc-0011
Romans-11-15	For if the casting away of them <i>be</i> the reconciling of the world, what <i>shall</i> the receiving <i>of them be</i>, but life from the dead?	Romans 11 : 15	Flowers_0001_80	bgc-0012
Romans-11-16	For if the firstfruit <i>be</i> holy, the lump <i>is</i> also <i>holy</i>: and if the root <i>be</i> holy, so <i>are</i> the branches.	Romans 11 : 16	Flowers_0001_81	bgc-0013
Romans-11-17	And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;	Romans 11 : 17	Flowers_0001_82	bgc-0014
Romans-11-18	Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.	Romans 11 : 18	Flowers_0001_83	bgc-0015
Romans-11-19	Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.	Romans 11 : 19	Flowers_0001_84	bgc-0016
Romans-11-20	Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:	Romans 11 : 20	Flowers_0001_85	bgc-0003
Romans-11-21	For if God spared not the natural branches, <i>take heed</i> lest he also spare not thee.	Romans 11 : 21	Flowers_0001_86	bgc-0004
Romans-11-22	Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in <i>his</i> goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.	Romans 11 : 22	Flowers_0001_87	bgc-0005
Romans-11-23	And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.	Romans 11 : 23	Flowers_0001_88	bgc-0006
Romans-11-24	For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural <i>branches</i>, be graffed into their own olive tree?	Romans 11 : 24	Flowers_0001_89	bgc-0007
Romans-11-25	For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.	Romans 11 : 25	Flowers_0001_90	bgc-0008
Romans-11-26	And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:	Romans 11 : 26	Flowers_0001_91	bgc-0009
Romans-11-27	For this <i>is</i> my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.	Romans 11 : 27	Flowers_0001_92	bgc-0010
Romans-11-28	As concerning the gospel, <i>they are</i> enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, <i>they are</i> beloved for the fathersâ€™ sakes.	Romans 11 : 28	Flowers_0001_93	bgc-0011
Romans-11-29	For the gifts and calling of God <i>are</i> without repentance.	Romans 11 : 29	Flowers_0001_94	bgc-0012
Romans-11-30	For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:	Romans 11 : 30	Flowers_0001_95	bgc-0013
Romans-11-31	Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.	Romans 11 : 31	Flowers_0001_96	bgc-0014
Romans-11-32	For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.	Romans 11 : 32	Flowers_0001_97	bgc-0015
Romans-11-33	O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable <i>are</i> his judgments, and his ways past finding out!	Romans 11 : 33	Flowers_0001_98	bgc-0016
Romans-11-34	For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counseller?	Romans 11 : 34	Flowers_0001_99	bgc-0003
Romans-11-35	Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?	Romans 11 : 35	Flowers_0001_100	bgc-0004
Romans-11-36	For of him, and through him, and to him, <i>are</i> all things: to whom <i>be</i> glory for ever. Amen.	Romans 11 : 36	Flowers_0001_101	bgc-0005
Romans-12-1	I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, <i>which is</i> your reasonable service.	Romans 12 : 1	Flowers_0001_102	bgc-0006
Romans-12-2	And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what <i>is</i> that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.	Romans 12 : 2	Flowers_0001_103	bgc-0007
Romans-12-3	For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think <i>of himself</i> more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.	Romans 12 : 3	Flowers_0001_104	bgc-0008
Romans-12-4	For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:	Romans 12 : 4	Flowers_0001_105	bgc-0009
Romans-12-5	So we, <i>being</i> many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.	Romans 12 : 5	Flowers_0001_106	bgc-0010
Romans-12-6	Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, <i>let us prophesy</i> according to the proportion of faith;	Romans 12 : 6	Flowers_0001_107	bgc-0011
Romans-12-7	Or ministry, <i>let us wait</i> on <i>our</i> ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;	Romans 12 : 7	Flowers_0001_108	bgc-0012
Romans-12-8	Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, <i>let him do it</i> with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.	Romans 12 : 8	Flowers_0001_109	bgc-0013
Romans-12-9	<i>Let</i> love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.	Romans 12 : 9	Flowers_0001_110	bgc-0014
Romans-12-10	<i>Be</i> kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;	Romans 12 : 10	Flowers_0001_111	bgc-0015
Romans-12-11	Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;	Romans 12 : 11	Flowers_0001_112	bgc-0016
Romans-12-12	Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;	Romans 12 : 12	Flowers_0001_113	bgc-0003
Romans-12-13	Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.	Romans 12 : 13	Flowers_0001_114	bgc-0004
Romans-12-14	Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.	Romans 12 : 14	Flowers_0001_115	bgc-0005
Romans-12-15	Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.	Romans 12 : 15	Flowers_0001_116	bgc-0006
Romans-12-16	<i>Be</i> of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.	Romans 12 : 16	Flowers_0001_117	bgc-0007
Romans-12-17	Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.	Romans 12 : 17	Flowers_0001_118	bgc-0008
Romans-12-18	If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.	Romans 12 : 18	Flowers_0001_119	bgc-0009
Romans-12-19	Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but <i>rather</i> give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance <i>is</i> mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.	Romans 12 : 19	Flowers_0001_120	bgc-0010
Romans-12-20	Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.	Romans 12 : 20	Flowers_0001_121	bgc-0011
Romans-12-21	Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.	Romans 12 : 21	Flowers_0001_122	bgc-0012
Romans-13-1	Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.	Romans 13 : 1	Flowers_0001_123	bgc-0013
Romans-13-2	Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.	Romans 13 : 2	Flowers_0001_124	bgc-0014
Romans-13-3	For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:	Romans 13 : 3	Flowers_0001_125	bgc-0015
Romans-13-4	For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to <i>execute</i> wrath upon him that doeth evil.	Romans 13 : 4	Flowers_0001_126	bgc-0016
Romans-13-5	Wherefore <i>ye</i> must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.	Romans 13 : 5	Flowers_0001_127	bgc-0003
Romans-13-6	For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are Godâ€™s ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.	Romans 13 : 6	Flowers_0001_128	bgc-0004
Romans-13-7	Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute <i>is due</i>; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.	Romans 13 : 7	Flowers_0001_129	bgc-0005
Romans-13-8	Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.	Romans 13 : 8	Flowers_0001_130	bgc-0006
Romans-13-9	For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if <i>there be</i> any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.	Romans 13 : 9	Flowers_0001_131	bgc-0007
Romans-13-10	Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love <i>is</i> the fulfilling of the law.	Romans 13 : 10	Flowers_0001_132	bgc-0008
Romans-13-11	And that, knowing the time, that now <i>it is</i> high time to awake out of sleep: for now <i>is</i> our salvation nearer than when we believed.	Romans 13 : 11	Flowers_0001_133	bgc-0009
Romans-13-12	The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.	Romans 13 : 12	Flowers_0001_134	bgc-0010
Romans-13-13	Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.	Romans 13 : 13	Flowers_0001_135	bgc-0011
Romans-13-14	But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to <i>fulfil</i> the lusts <i>thereof</i>.	Romans 13 : 14	Flowers_0001_136	bgc-0012
Romans-14-1	Him that is weak in the faith receive ye, <i>but</i> not to doubtful disputations.	Romans 14 : 1	Flowers_0001_137	bgc-0013
Romans-14-2	For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.	Romans 14 : 2	Flowers_0001_138	bgc-0014
Romans-14-3	Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.	Romans 14 : 3	Flowers_0001_139	bgc-0015
Romans-14-4	Who art thou that judgest another manâ€™s servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.	Romans 14 : 4	Flowers_0001_140	bgc-0016
Romans-14-5	One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day <i>alike</i>. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.	Romans 14 : 5	Flowers_0001_141	bgc-0003
Romans-14-6	He that regardeth the day, regardeth <i>it</i> unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard <i>it</i>. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.	Romans 14 : 6	Flowers_0001_142	bgc-0004
Romans-14-7	For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.	Romans 14 : 7	Flowers_0001_143	bgc-0005
Romans-14-8	For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lordâ€™s.	Romans 14 : 8	Flowers_0001_144	bgc-0006
Romans-14-9	For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.	Romans 14 : 9	Flowers_0001_145	bgc-0007
Romans-14-10	But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.	Romans 14 : 10	Flowers_0001_146	bgc-0008
Romans-14-11	For it is written, <i>As</i> I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.	Romans 14 : 11	Flowers_0001_147	bgc-0009
Romans-14-12	So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.	Romans 14 : 12	Flowers_0001_148	bgc-0010
Romans-14-13	Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in <i>his</i> brotherâ€™s way.	Romans 14 : 13	Flowers_0001_149	bgc-0011
Romans-14-14	I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that <i>there is</i> nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him <i>it is</i> unclean.	Romans 14 : 14	Flowers_0001_150	bgc-0012
Romans-14-15	But if thy brother be grieved with <i>thy</i> meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.	Romans 14 : 15	Flowers_0001_151	bgc-0013
Romans-14-16	Let not then your good be evil spoken of:	Romans 14 : 16	Flowers_0001_152	bgc-0014
Romans-14-17	For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.	Romans 14 : 17	Flowers_0001_153	bgc-0015
Romans-14-18	For he that in these things serveth Christ <i>is</i> acceptable to God, and approved of men.	Romans 14 : 18	Flowers_0001_154	bgc-0016
Romans-14-19	Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.	Romans 14 : 19	Flowers_0001_155	bgc-0003
Romans-14-20	For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed <i>are</i> pure; but <i>it is</i> evil for that man who eateth with offence.	Romans 14 : 20	Flowers_0001_156	bgc-0004
Romans-14-21	<i>It is</i> good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor <i>any thing</i> whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.	Romans 14 : 21	Flowers_0001_157	bgc-0005
Romans-14-22	Hast thou faith? have <i>it</i> to thyself before God. Happy <i>is</i> he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.	Romans 14 : 22	Flowers_0001_158	bgc-0006
Romans-14-23	And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because <i>he eateth</i> not of faith: for whatsoever <i>is</i> not of faith is sin.	Romans 14 : 23	Flowers_0001_159	bgc-0007
Romans-15-1	We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.	Romans 15 : 1	Flowers_0001_160	bgc-0008
Romans-15-2	Let every one of us please <i>his</i> neighbour for <i>his</i> good to edification.	Romans 15 : 2	Flowers_0001_161	bgc-0009
Romans-15-3	For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me.	Romans 15 : 3	Flowers_0001_162	bgc-0010
Romans-15-4	For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope.	Romans 15 : 4	Flowers_0001_163	bgc-0011
Romans-15-5	Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus:	Romans 15 : 5	Flowers_0001_164	bgc-0012
Romans-15-6	That ye may with one mind <i>and</i> one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.	Romans 15 : 6	Flowers_0001_165	bgc-0013
Romans-15-7	Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.	Romans 15 : 7	Flowers_0001_166	bgc-0014
Romans-15-8	Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises <i>made</i> unto the fathers:	Romans 15 : 8	Flowers_0001_167	bgc-0015
Romans-15-9	And that the Gentiles might glorify God for <i>his</i> mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.	Romans 15 : 9	Flowers_0001_168	bgc-0016
Romans-15-10	And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.	Romans 15 : 10	Flowers_0001_169	bgc-0003
Romans-15-11	And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people.	Romans 15 : 11	Flowers_0001_170	bgc-0004
Romans-15-12	And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust.	Romans 15 : 12	Flowers_0001_171	bgc-0005
Romans-15-13	Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.	Romans 15 : 13	Flowers_0001_172	bgc-0006
Romans-15-14	And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.	Romans 15 : 14	Flowers_0001_173	bgc-0007
Romans-15-15	Nevertheless, brethren, I have written the more boldly unto you in some sort, as putting you in mind, because of the grace that is given to me of God,	Romans 15 : 15	Flowers_0001_174	bgc-0008
Romans-15-16	That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.	Romans 15 : 16	Flowers_0001_175	bgc-0009
Romans-15-17	I have therefore whereof I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God.	Romans 15 : 17	Flowers_0001_176	bgc-0010
Romans-15-18	For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me, to make the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed,	Romans 15 : 18	Flowers_0001_177	bgc-0011
Romans-15-19	Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.	Romans 15 : 19	Flowers_0001_178	bgc-0012
Romans-15-20	Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another manâ€™s foundation:	Romans 15 : 20	Flowers_0001_179	bgc-0013
Romans-15-21	But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand.	Romans 15 : 21	Flowers_0001_180	bgc-0014
Romans-15-22	For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.	Romans 15 : 22	Flowers_0001_181	bgc-0015
Romans-15-23	But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;	Romans 15 : 23	Flowers_0001_182	bgc-0016
Romans-15-24	Whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your <i>company</i>.	Romans 15 : 24	Flowers_0001_183	bgc-0003
Romans-15-25	But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.	Romans 15 : 25	Flowers_0001_184	bgc-0004
Romans-15-26	For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.	Romans 15 : 26	Flowers_0001_185	bgc-0005
Romans-15-27	It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things.	Romans 15 : 27	Flowers_0001_186	bgc-0006
Romans-15-28	When therefore I have performed this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain.	Romans 15 : 28	Flowers_0001_187	bgc-0007
Romans-15-29	And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.	Romans 15 : 29	Flowers_0001_188	bgc-0008
Romans-15-30	Now I beseech you, brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christâ€™s sake, and for the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in <i>your</i> prayers to God for me;	Romans 15 : 30	Flowers_0001_189	bgc-0009
Romans-15-31	That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which <i>I have</i> for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;	Romans 15 : 31	Flowers_0001_190	bgc-0010
Romans-15-32	That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed.	Romans 15 : 32	Flowers_0001_191	bgc-0011
Romans-15-33	Now the God of peace <i>be</i> with you all. Amen.	Romans 15 : 33	Flowers_0001_192	bgc-0012
Romans-16-1	I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:	Romans 16 : 1	Flowers_0001_193	bgc-0013
Romans-16-2	That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also.	Romans 16 : 2	Flowers_0001_194	bgc-0014
Romans-16-3	Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:	Romans 16 : 3	Flowers_0001_195	bgc-0015
Romans-16-4	Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.	Romans 16 : 4	Flowers_0001_196	bgc-0016
Romans-16-5	Likewise <i>greet</i> the church that is in their house. Salute my wellbeloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ.	Romans 16 : 5	Flowers_0001_197	bgc-0003
Romans-16-6	Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us.	Romans 16 : 6	Flowers_0001_198	bgc-0004
Romans-16-7	Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellowprisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.	Romans 16 : 7	Flowers_0001_199	bgc-0005
Romans-16-8	Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord.	Romans 16 : 8	Flowers_0001_200	bgc-0006
Romans-16-9	Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.	Romans 16 : 9	Flowers_0001_201	bgc-0007

Romans-16-12	Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, which laboured much in the Lord.	Romans 16 : 12	Flowers_0001_204	bgc-0010

Romans-16-15	Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints which are with them.	Romans 16 : 15	Flowers_0001_207	bgc-0013
Romans-16-16	Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you.	Romans 16 : 16	Flowers_0001_208	bgc-0014
Romans-16-17	Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.	Romans 16 : 17	Flowers_0001_209	bgc-0015
Romans-16-18	For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.	Romans 16 : 18	Flowers_0001_210	bgc-0016
Romans-16-19	For your obedience is come abroad unto all <i>men</i>. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil.	Romans 16 : 19	Flowers_0001_211	bgc-0003
Romans-16-20	And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with you. Amen.	Romans 16 : 20	Flowers_0001_212	bgc-0004

Romans-16-24	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with you all. Amen.	Romans 16 : 24	Flowers_0001_216	bgc-0008
Romans-16-25	Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,	Romans 16 : 25	Flowers_0001_217	bgc-0009
Romans-16-26	But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:	Romans 16 : 26	Flowers_0001_218	bgc-0010
Romans-16-27	To God only wise, <i>be</i> glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen. 	Romans 16 : 27	Flowers_0001_219	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-1-1	Paul, called <i>to be</i> an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes <i>our</i> brother,	1-Corinthians 1 : 1	Flowers_0001_220	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-1-2	Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called <i>to be</i> saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:	1-Corinthians 1 : 2	Flowers_0001_221	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-1-3	Grace <i>be</i> unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and <i>from</i> the Lord Jesus Christ.	1-Corinthians 1 : 3	Flowers_0001_222	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-1-4	I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;	1-Corinthians 1 : 4	Flowers_0001_223	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-1-5	That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and <i>in</i> all knowledge;	1-Corinthians 1 : 5	Flowers_0001_224	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-1-6	Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:	1-Corinthians 1 : 6	Flowers_0001_225	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-1-7	So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:	1-Corinthians 1 : 7	Flowers_0001_226	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-1-8	Who shall also confirm you unto the end, <i>that ye may be</i> blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.	1-Corinthians 1 : 8	Flowers_0001_227	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-1-9	God <i>is</i> faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.	1-Corinthians 1 : 9	Flowers_0001_228	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-1-10	Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and <i>that</i> there be no divisions among you; but <i>that</i> ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.	1-Corinthians 1 : 10	Flowers_0001_229	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-1-11	For it hath been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by them <i>which are of the house</i> of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.	1-Corinthians 1 : 11	Flowers_0001_230	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-1-12	Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.	1-Corinthians 1 : 12	Flowers_0001_231	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-1-13	Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?	1-Corinthians 1 : 13	Flowers_0001_232	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-1-14	I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;	1-Corinthians 1 : 14	Flowers_0001_233	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-1-15	Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.	1-Corinthians 1 : 15	Flowers_0001_234	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-1-16	And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.	1-Corinthians 1 : 16	Flowers_0001_235	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-1-17	For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.	1-Corinthians 1 : 17	Flowers_0001_236	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-1-18	For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.	1-Corinthians 1 : 18	Flowers_0001_237	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-1-19	For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.	1-Corinthians 1 : 19	Flowers_0001_238	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-1-20	Where <i>is</i> the wise? where <i>is</i> the scribe? where <i>is</i> the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?	1-Corinthians 1 : 20	Flowers_0001_239	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-1-21	For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.	1-Corinthians 1 : 21	Flowers_0001_240	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-1-22	For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:	1-Corinthians 1 : 22	Flowers_0001_241	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-1-23	But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;	1-Corinthians 1 : 23	Flowers_0001_242	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-1-24	But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.	1-Corinthians 1 : 24	Flowers_0001_243	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-1-25	Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.	1-Corinthians 1 : 25	Flowers_0001_244	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-1-26	For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, <i>are called</i>:	1-Corinthians 1 : 26	Flowers_0001_245	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-1-27	But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;	1-Corinthians 1 : 27	Flowers_0001_246	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-1-28	And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, <i>yea</i>, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:	1-Corinthians 1 : 28	Flowers_0001_247	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-1-29	That no flesh should glory in his presence.	1-Corinthians 1 : 29	Flowers_0001_248	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-1-30	But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:	1-Corinthians 1 : 30	Flowers_0001_249	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-1-31	That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.	1-Corinthians 1 : 31	Flowers_0001_250	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-2-1	And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.	1-Corinthians 2 : 1	Flowers_0001_251	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-2-2	For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.	1-Corinthians 2 : 2	Flowers_0001_252	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-2-3	And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.	1-Corinthians 2 : 3	Flowers_0001_253	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-2-4	And my speech and my preaching <i>was</i> not with enticing words of manâ€™s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:	1-Corinthians 2 : 4	Flowers_0001_254	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-2-5	That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.	1-Corinthians 2 : 5	Flowers_0001_255	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-2-6	Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:	1-Corinthians 2 : 6	Flowers_0001_256	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-2-7	But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, <i>even</i> the hidden <i>wisdom</i>, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:	1-Corinthians 2 : 7	Flowers_0001_257	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-2-8	Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known <i>it</i>, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.	1-Corinthians 2 : 8	Flowers_0001_258	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-2-9	But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.	1-Corinthians 2 : 9	Flowers_0001_259	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-2-10	But God hath revealed <i>them</i> unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.	1-Corinthians 2 : 10	Flowers_0001_260	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-2-11	For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.	1-Corinthians 2 : 11	Flowers_0001_261	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-2-12	Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.	1-Corinthians 2 : 12	Flowers_0001_262	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-2-13	Which things also we speak, not in the words which manâ€™s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.	1-Corinthians 2 : 13	Flowers_0001_263	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-2-14	But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know <i>them</i>, because they are spiritually discerned.	1-Corinthians 2 : 14	Flowers_0001_264	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-2-15	But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.	1-Corinthians 2 : 15	Flowers_0001_265	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-2-16	For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.	1-Corinthians 2 : 16	Flowers_0001_266	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-3-1	And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, <i>even</i> as unto babes in Christ.	1-Corinthians 3 : 1	Flowers_0001_267	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-3-2	I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able <i>to bear it</i>, neither yet now are ye able.	1-Corinthians 3 : 2	Flowers_0001_268	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-3-3	For ye are yet carnal: for whereas <i>there is</i> among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?	1-Corinthians 3 : 3	Flowers_0001_269	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-3-4	For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I <i>am</i> of Apollos; are ye not carnal?	1-Corinthians 3 : 4	Flowers_0001_270	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-3-5	Who then is Paul, and who <i>is</i> Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?	1-Corinthians 3 : 5	Flowers_0001_271	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-3-6	I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.	1-Corinthians 3 : 6	Flowers_0001_272	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-3-7	So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.	1-Corinthians 3 : 7	Flowers_0001_273	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-3-8	Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.	1-Corinthians 3 : 8	Flowers_0001_274	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-3-9	For we are labourers together with God: ye are Godâ€™s husbandry, <i>ye are</i> Godâ€™s building.	1-Corinthians 3 : 9	Flowers_0001_275	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-3-10	According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.	1-Corinthians 3 : 10	Flowers_0001_276	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-3-11	For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.	1-Corinthians 3 : 11	Flowers_0001_277	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-3-12	Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;	1-Corinthians 3 : 12	Flowers_0001_278	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-3-13	Every manâ€™s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every manâ€™s work of what sort it is.	1-Corinthians 3 : 13	Flowers_0001_279	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-3-14	If any manâ€™s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.	1-Corinthians 3 : 14	Flowers_0001_280	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-3-15	If any manâ€™s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.	1-Corinthians 3 : 15	Flowers_0001_281	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-3-16	Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and <i>that</i> the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?	1-Corinthians 3 : 16	Flowers_0001_282	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-3-17	If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which <i>temple</i> ye are.	1-Corinthians 3 : 17	Flowers_0001_283	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-3-18	Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.	1-Corinthians 3 : 18	Flowers_0001_284	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-3-19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.	1-Corinthians 3 : 19	Flowers_0001_285	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-3-20	And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.	1-Corinthians 3 : 20	Flowers_0001_286	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-3-21	Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;	1-Corinthians 3 : 21	Flowers_0001_287	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-3-22	Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;	1-Corinthians 3 : 22	Flowers_0001_288	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-3-23	And ye are Christâ€™s; and Christ <i>is</i> Godâ€™s.	1-Corinthians 3 : 23	Flowers_0001_289	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-4-1	Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.	1-Corinthians 4 : 1	Flowers_0001_290	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-4-2	Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.	1-Corinthians 4 : 2	Flowers_0001_291	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-4-3	But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of manâ€™s judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.	1-Corinthians 4 : 3	Flowers_0001_292	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-4-4	For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.	1-Corinthians 4 : 4	Flowers_0001_293	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-4-5	Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.	1-Corinthians 4 : 5	Flowers_0001_294	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-4-6	And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and <i>to</i> Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think <i>of men</i> above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.	1-Corinthians 4 : 6	Flowers_0001_295	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-4-7	For who maketh thee to differ <i>from another</i>? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive <i>it</i>, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received <i>it</i>?	1-Corinthians 4 : 7	Flowers_0001_296	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-4-8	Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.	1-Corinthians 4 : 8	Flowers_0001_297	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-4-9	For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.	1-Corinthians 4 : 9	Flowers_0001_298	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-4-10	We <i>are</i> fools for Christâ€™s sake, but ye <i>are</i> wise in Christ; we <i>are</i> weak, but ye <i>are</i> strong; ye <i>are</i> honourable, but we <i>are</i> despised.	1-Corinthians 4 : 10	Flowers_0001_299	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-4-11	Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;	1-Corinthians 4 : 11	Flowers_0001_300	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-4-12	And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:	1-Corinthians 4 : 12	Flowers_0001_301	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-4-13	Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, <i>and are</i> the offscouring of all things unto this day.	1-Corinthians 4 : 13	Flowers_0001_302	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-4-14	I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn <i>you</i>.	1-Corinthians 4 : 14	Flowers_0001_303	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-4-15	For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet <i>have ye</i> not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.	1-Corinthians 4 : 15	Flowers_0001_304	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-4-16	Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.	1-Corinthians 4 : 16	Flowers_0001_305	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-4-17	For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.	1-Corinthians 4 : 17	Flowers_0001_306	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-4-18	Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.	1-Corinthians 4 : 18	Flowers_0001_307	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-4-19	But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.	1-Corinthians 4 : 19	Flowers_0001_308	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-4-20	For the kingdom of God <i>is</i> not in word, but in power.	1-Corinthians 4 : 20	Flowers_0001_309	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-4-21	What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and <i>in</i> the spirit of meekness?	1-Corinthians 4 : 21	Flowers_0001_310	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-5-1	It is reported commonly <i>that there is</i> fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his fatherâ€™s wife.	1-Corinthians 5 : 1	Flowers_0001_311	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-5-2	And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.	1-Corinthians 5 : 2	Flowers_0001_312	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-5-3	For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, <i>concerning</i> him that hath so done this deed,	1-Corinthians 5 : 3	Flowers_0001_313	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-5-4	In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,	1-Corinthians 5 : 4	Flowers_0001_314	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-5-5	To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.	1-Corinthians 5 : 5	Flowers_0001_315	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-5-6	Your glorying <i>is</i> not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?	1-Corinthians 5 : 6	Flowers_0001_316	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-5-7	Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:	1-Corinthians 5 : 7	Flowers_0001_317	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-5-8	Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened <i>bread</i> of sincerity and truth.	1-Corinthians 5 : 8	Flowers_0001_318	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-5-9	I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:	1-Corinthians 5 : 9	Flowers_0001_319	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-5-10	Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.	1-Corinthians 5 : 10	Flowers_0001_320	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-5-11	But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.	1-Corinthians 5 : 11	Flowers_0001_321	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-5-12	For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?	1-Corinthians 5 : 12	Flowers_0001_322	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-5-13	But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.	1-Corinthians 5 : 13	Flowers_0001_323	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-6-1	Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?	1-Corinthians 6 : 1	Flowers_0001_324	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-6-2	Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?	1-Corinthians 6 : 2	Flowers_0001_325	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-6-3	Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?	1-Corinthians 6 : 3	Flowers_0001_326	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-6-4	If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.	1-Corinthians 6 : 4	Flowers_0001_327	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-6-5	I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?	1-Corinthians 6 : 5	Flowers_0001_328	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-6-6	But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.	1-Corinthians 6 : 6	Flowers_0001_329	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-6-7	Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather <i>suffer yourselves to</i> be defrauded?	1-Corinthians 6 : 7	Flowers_0001_330	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-6-8	Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that <i>your</i> brethren.	1-Corinthians 6 : 8	Flowers_0001_331	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-6-9	Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,	1-Corinthians 6 : 9	Flowers_0001_332	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-6-10	Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.	1-Corinthians 6 : 10	Flowers_0001_333	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-6-11	And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.	1-Corinthians 6 : 11	Flowers_0001_334	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-6-12	All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.	1-Corinthians 6 : 12	Flowers_0001_335	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-6-13	Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body <i>is</i> not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.	1-Corinthians 6 : 13	Flowers_0001_336	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-6-14	And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.	1-Corinthians 6 : 14	Flowers_0001_337	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-6-15	Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make <i>them</i> the members of an harlot? God forbid.	1-Corinthians 6 : 15	Flowers_0001_338	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-6-16	What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.	1-Corinthians 6 : 16	Flowers_0001_339	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-6-17	But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.	1-Corinthians 6 : 17	Flowers_0001_340	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-6-18	Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.	1-Corinthians 6 : 18	Flowers_0001_341	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-6-19	What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost <i>which is</i> in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?	1-Corinthians 6 : 19	Flowers_0001_342	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-6-20	For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are Godâ€™s.	1-Corinthians 6 : 20	Flowers_0001_343	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-7-1	Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: <i>It is</i> good for a man not to touch a woman.	1-Corinthians 7 : 1	Flowers_0001_1	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-7-2	Nevertheless, <i>to avoid</i> fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.	1-Corinthians 7 : 2	Flowers_0001_2	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-7-3	Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.	1-Corinthians 7 : 3	Flowers_0001_3	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-7-4	The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.	1-Corinthians 7 : 4	Flowers_0001_4	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-7-5	Defraud ye not one the other, except <i>it be</i> with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.	1-Corinthians 7 : 5	Flowers_0001_5	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-7-6	But I speak this by permission, <i>and</i> not of commandment.	1-Corinthians 7 : 6	Flowers_0001_6	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-7-7	For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.	1-Corinthians 7 : 7	Flowers_0001_7	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-7-8	I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.	1-Corinthians 7 : 8	Flowers_0001_8	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-7-9	But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.	1-Corinthians 7 : 9	Flowers_0001_9	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-7-10	And unto the married I command, <i>yet</i> not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from <i>her</i> husband:	1-Corinthians 7 : 10	Flowers_0001_10	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-7-11	But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to <i>her</i> husband: and let not the husband put away <i>his</i> wife.	1-Corinthians 7 : 11	Flowers_0001_11	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-7-12	But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.	1-Corinthians 7 : 12	Flowers_0001_12	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-7-13	And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.	1-Corinthians 7 : 13	Flowers_0001_13	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-7-14	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.	1-Corinthians 7 : 14	Flowers_0001_14	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-7-15	But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such <i>cases</i>: but God hath called us to peace.	1-Corinthians 7 : 15	Flowers_0001_15	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-7-16	For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save <i>thy</i> husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save <i>thy</i> wife?	1-Corinthians 7 : 16	Flowers_0001_16	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-7-17	But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.	1-Corinthians 7 : 17	Flowers_0001_17	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-7-18	Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.	1-Corinthians 7 : 18	Flowers_0001_18	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-7-19	Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.	1-Corinthians 7 : 19	Flowers_0001_19	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-7-20	Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.	1-Corinthians 7 : 20	Flowers_0001_20	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-7-21	Art thou called <i>being</i> a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use <i>it</i> rather.	1-Corinthians 7 : 21	Flowers_0001_21	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-7-22	For he that is called in the Lord, <i>being</i> a servant, is the Lordâ€™s freeman: likewise also he that is called, <i>being</i> free, is Christâ€™s servant.	1-Corinthians 7 : 22	Flowers_0001_22	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-7-23	Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.	1-Corinthians 7 : 23	Flowers_0001_23	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-7-24	Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.	1-Corinthians 7 : 24	Flowers_0001_24	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-7-25	Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.	1-Corinthians 7 : 25	Flowers_0001_25	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-7-26	I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, <i>I say</i>, that <i>it is</i> good for a man so to be.	1-Corinthians 7 : 26	Flowers_0001_26	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-7-27	Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.	1-Corinthians 7 : 27	Flowers_0001_27	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-7-28	But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.	1-Corinthians 7 : 28	Flowers_0001_28	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-7-29	But this I say, brethren, the time <i>is</i> short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;	1-Corinthians 7 : 29	Flowers_0001_29	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-7-30	And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;	1-Corinthians 7 : 30	Flowers_0001_30	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-7-31	And they that use this world, as not abusing <i>it</i>: for the fashion of this world passeth away.	1-Corinthians 7 : 31	Flowers_0001_31	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-7-32	But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:	1-Corinthians 7 : 32	Flowers_0001_32	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-7-33	But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please <i>his</i> wife.	1-Corinthians 7 : 33	Flowers_0001_33	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-7-34	There is difference <i>also</i> between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please <i>her</i> husband.	1-Corinthians 7 : 34	Flowers_0001_34	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-7-35	And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.	1-Corinthians 7 : 35	Flowers_0001_35	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-7-36	But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of <i>her</i> age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.	1-Corinthians 7 : 36	Flowers_0001_36	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-7-37	Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.	1-Corinthians 7 : 37	Flowers_0001_37	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-7-38	So then he that giveth <i>her</i> in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth <i>her</i> not in marriage doeth better.	1-Corinthians 7 : 38	Flowers_0001_38	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-7-39	The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.	1-Corinthians 7 : 39	Flowers_0001_39	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-7-40	But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.	1-Corinthians 7 : 40	Flowers_0001_40	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-8-1	Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth.	1-Corinthians 8 : 1	Flowers_0001_41	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-8-2	And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know.	1-Corinthians 8 : 2	Flowers_0001_42	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-8-3	But if any man love God, the same is known of him.	1-Corinthians 8 : 3	Flowers_0001_43	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-8-4	As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol <i>is</i> nothing in the world, and that <i>there is</i> none other God but one.	1-Corinthians 8 : 4	Flowers_0001_44	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-8-5	For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)	1-Corinthians 8 : 5	Flowers_0001_45	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-8-6	But to us <i>there is but</i> one God, the Father, of whom <i>are</i> all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom <i>are</i> all things, and we by him.	1-Corinthians 8 : 6	Flowers_0001_46	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-8-7	Howbeit <i>there is</i> not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol unto this hour eat <i>it</i> as a thing offered unto an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.	1-Corinthians 8 : 7	Flowers_0001_47	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-8-8	But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.	1-Corinthians 8 : 8	Flowers_0001_48	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-8-9	But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.	1-Corinthians 8 : 9	Flowers_0001_49	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-8-10	For if any man see thee which hast knowledge sit at meat in the idolâ€™s temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;	1-Corinthians 8 : 10	Flowers_0001_50	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-8-11	And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?	1-Corinthians 8 : 11	Flowers_0001_51	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-8-12	But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.	1-Corinthians 8 : 12	Flowers_0001_52	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-8-13	Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend.	1-Corinthians 8 : 13	Flowers_0001_53	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-9-1	Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?	1-Corinthians 9 : 1	Flowers_0001_54	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-9-2	If I be not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you: for the seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.	1-Corinthians 9 : 2	Flowers_0001_55	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-9-3	Mine answer to them that do examine me is this,	1-Corinthians 9 : 3	Flowers_0001_56	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-9-4	Have we not power to eat and to drink?	1-Corinthians 9 : 4	Flowers_0001_57	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-9-5	Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and <i>as</i> the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?	1-Corinthians 9 : 5	Flowers_0001_58	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-9-6	Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?	1-Corinthians 9 : 6	Flowers_0001_59	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-9-7	Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?	1-Corinthians 9 : 7	Flowers_0001_60	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-9-8	Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?	1-Corinthians 9 : 8	Flowers_0001_61	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-9-9	For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn. Doth God take care for oxen?	1-Corinthians 9 : 9	Flowers_0001_62	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-9-10	Or saith he <i>it</i> altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, <i>this</i> is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope.	1-Corinthians 9 : 10	Flowers_0001_63	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-9-11	If we have sown unto you spiritual things, <i>is it</i> a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?	1-Corinthians 9 : 11	Flowers_0001_64	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-9-12	If others be partakers of <i>this</i> power over you, <i>are</i> not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.	1-Corinthians 9 : 12	Flowers_0001_65	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-9-13	Do ye not know that they which minister about holy things live <i>of the things</i> of the temple? and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar?	1-Corinthians 9 : 13	Flowers_0001_66	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-9-14	Even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.	1-Corinthians 9 : 14	Flowers_0001_67	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-9-15	But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for <i>it were</i> better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.	1-Corinthians 9 : 15	Flowers_0001_68	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-9-16	For though I preach the gospel, I have nothing to glory of: for necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach not the gospel!	1-Corinthians 9 : 16	Flowers_0001_69	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-9-17	For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation <i>of the gospel</i> is committed unto me.	1-Corinthians 9 : 17	Flowers_0001_70	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-9-18	What is my reward then? <i>Verily</i> that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel.	1-Corinthians 9 : 18	Flowers_0001_71	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-9-19	For though I be free from all <i>men</i>, yet have I made myself servant unto all, that I might gain the more.	1-Corinthians 9 : 19	Flowers_0001_72	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-9-20	And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;	1-Corinthians 9 : 20	Flowers_0001_73	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-9-21	To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.	1-Corinthians 9 : 21	Flowers_0001_74	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-9-22	To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all <i>men</i>, that I might by all means save some.	1-Corinthians 9 : 22	Flowers_0001_75	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-9-23	And this I do for the gospelâ€™s sake, that I might be partaker thereof with <i>you</i>.	1-Corinthians 9 : 23	Flowers_0001_76	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-9-24	Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain.	1-Corinthians 9 : 24	Flowers_0001_77	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-9-25	And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they <i>do it</i> to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.	1-Corinthians 9 : 25	Flowers_0001_78	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-9-26	I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth the air:	1-Corinthians 9 : 26	Flowers_0001_79	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-9-27	But I keep under my body, and bring <i>it</i> into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway.	1-Corinthians 9 : 27	Flowers_0001_80	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-10-1	Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;	1-Corinthians 10 : 1	Flowers_0001_81	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-10-2	And were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;	1-Corinthians 10 : 2	Flowers_0001_82	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-10-3	And did all eat the same spiritual meat;	1-Corinthians 10 : 3	Flowers_0001_83	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-10-4	And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.	1-Corinthians 10 : 4	Flowers_0001_84	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-10-5	But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.	1-Corinthians 10 : 5	Flowers_0001_85	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-10-6	Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.	1-Corinthians 10 : 6	Flowers_0001_86	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-10-7	Neither be ye idolaters, as <i>were</i> some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.	1-Corinthians 10 : 7	Flowers_0001_87	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-10-8	Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.	1-Corinthians 10 : 8	Flowers_0001_88	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-10-9	Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents.	1-Corinthians 10 : 9	Flowers_0001_89	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-10-10	Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer.	1-Corinthians 10 : 10	Flowers_0001_90	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-10-11	Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come.	1-Corinthians 10 : 11	Flowers_0001_91	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-10-12	Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.	1-Corinthians 10 : 12	Flowers_0001_92	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-10-13	There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God <i>is</i> faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear <i>it</i>.	1-Corinthians 10 : 13	Flowers_0001_93	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-10-14	Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.	1-Corinthians 10 : 14	Flowers_0001_94	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-10-15	I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.	1-Corinthians 10 : 15	Flowers_0001_95	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-10-16	The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?	1-Corinthians 10 : 16	Flowers_0001_96	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-10-17	For we <i>being</i> many are one bread, <i>and</i> one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.	1-Corinthians 10 : 17	Flowers_0001_97	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-10-18	Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?	1-Corinthians 10 : 18	Flowers_0001_98	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-10-19	What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?	1-Corinthians 10 : 19	Flowers_0001_99	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-10-20	But <i>I say</i>, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have fellowship with devils.	1-Corinthians 10 : 20	Flowers_0001_100	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-10-21	Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lordâ€™s table, and of the table of devils.	1-Corinthians 10 : 21	Flowers_0001_101	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-10-22	Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?	1-Corinthians 10 : 22	Flowers_0001_102	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-10-23	All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not.	1-Corinthians 10 : 23	Flowers_0001_103	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-10-24	Let no man seek his own, but every man anotherâ€™s <i>wealth</i>.	1-Corinthians 10 : 24	Flowers_0001_104	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-10-25	Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, <i>that</i> eat, asking no question for conscience sake:	1-Corinthians 10 : 25	Flowers_0001_105	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-10-26	For the earth <i>is</i> the Lordâ€™s, and the fulness thereof.	1-Corinthians 10 : 26	Flowers_0001_106	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-10-27	If any of them that believe not bid you <i>to a feast</i>, and ye be disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.	1-Corinthians 10 : 27	Flowers_0001_107	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-10-28	But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth <i>is</i> the Lordâ€™s, and the fulness thereof:	1-Corinthians 10 : 28	Flowers_0001_108	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-10-29	Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another <i>manâ€™s</i> conscience?	1-Corinthians 10 : 29	Flowers_0001_109	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-10-30	For if I by grace be a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?	1-Corinthians 10 : 30	Flowers_0001_110	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-10-31	Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.	1-Corinthians 10 : 31	Flowers_0001_111	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-10-32	Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:	1-Corinthians 10 : 32	Flowers_0001_112	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-10-33	Even as I please all <i>men</i> in all <i>things</i>, not seeking mine own profit, but the <i>profit</i> of many, that they may be saved.	1-Corinthians 10 : 33	Flowers_0001_113	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-11-1	Be ye followers of me, even as I also <i>am</i> of Christ.	1-Corinthians 11 : 1	Flowers_0001_114	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-11-2	Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered <i>them</i> to you.	1-Corinthians 11 : 2	Flowers_0001_115	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-11-3	But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman <i>is</i> the man; and the head of Christ <i>is</i> God.	1-Corinthians 11 : 3	Flowers_0001_116	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-11-4	Every man praying or prophesying, having <i>his</i> head covered, dishonoureth his head.	1-Corinthians 11 : 4	Flowers_0001_117	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-11-5	But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with <i>her</i> head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.	1-Corinthians 11 : 5	Flowers_0001_118	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-11-6	For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.	1-Corinthians 11 : 6	Flowers_0001_119	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-11-7	For a man indeed ought not to cover <i>his</i> head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.	1-Corinthians 11 : 7	Flowers_0001_120	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-11-8	For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.	1-Corinthians 11 : 8	Flowers_0001_121	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-11-9	Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.	1-Corinthians 11 : 9	Flowers_0001_122	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-11-10	For this cause ought the woman to have power on <i>her</i> head because of the angels.	1-Corinthians 11 : 10	Flowers_0001_123	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-11-11	Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.	1-Corinthians 11 : 11	Flowers_0001_124	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-11-12	For as the woman <i>is</i> of the man, even so <i>is</i> the man also by the woman; but all things of God.	1-Corinthians 11 : 12	Flowers_0001_125	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-11-13	Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?	1-Corinthians 11 : 13	Flowers_0001_126	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-11-14	Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?	1-Corinthians 11 : 14	Flowers_0001_127	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-11-15	But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for <i>her</i> hair is given her for a covering.	1-Corinthians 11 : 15	Flowers_0001_128	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-11-16	But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.	1-Corinthians 11 : 16	Flowers_0001_129	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-11-17	Now in this that I declare <i>unto you</i> I praise <i>you</i> not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.	1-Corinthians 11 : 17	Flowers_0001_130	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-11-18	For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.	1-Corinthians 11 : 18	Flowers_0001_131	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-11-19	For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.	1-Corinthians 11 : 19	Flowers_0001_132	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-11-20	When ye come together therefore into one place, <i>this</i> is not to eat the Lordâ€™s supper.	1-Corinthians 11 : 20	Flowers_0001_133	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-11-21	For in eating every one taketh before <i>other</i> his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.	1-Corinthians 11 : 21	Flowers_0001_134	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-11-22	What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise <i>you</i> not.	1-Corinthians 11 : 22	Flowers_0001_135	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-11-23	For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the <i>same</i> night in which he was betrayed took bread:	1-Corinthians 11 : 23	Flowers_0001_136	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-11-24	And when he had given thanks, he brake <i>it</i>, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.	1-Corinthians 11 : 24	Flowers_0001_137	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-11-25	After the same manner also <i>he took</i> the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink <i>it</i>, in remembrance of me.	1-Corinthians 11 : 25	Flowers_0001_138	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-11-26	For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lordâ€™s death till he come.	1-Corinthians 11 : 26	Flowers_0001_139	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-11-27	Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink <i>this</i> cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.	1-Corinthians 11 : 27	Flowers_0001_140	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-11-28	But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of <i>that</i> bread, and drink of <i>that</i> cup.	1-Corinthians 11 : 28	Flowers_0001_141	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-11-29	For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lordâ€™s body.	1-Corinthians 11 : 29	Flowers_0001_142	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-11-30	For this cause many <i>are</i> weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.	1-Corinthians 11 : 30	Flowers_0001_143	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-11-31	For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.	1-Corinthians 11 : 31	Flowers_0001_144	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-11-32	But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.	1-Corinthians 11 : 32	Flowers_0001_145	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-11-33	Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.	1-Corinthians 11 : 33	Flowers_0001_146	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-11-34	And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.	1-Corinthians 11 : 34	Flowers_0001_147	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-12-1	Now concerning spiritual <i>gifts</i>, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.	1-Corinthians 12 : 1	Flowers_0001_148	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-12-2	Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.	1-Corinthians 12 : 2	Flowers_0001_149	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-12-3	Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and <i>that</i> no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.	1-Corinthians 12 : 3	Flowers_0001_150	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-12-4	Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.	1-Corinthians 12 : 4	Flowers_0001_151	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-12-5	And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.	1-Corinthians 12 : 5	Flowers_0001_152	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-12-6	And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.	1-Corinthians 12 : 6	Flowers_0001_153	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-12-7	But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.	1-Corinthians 12 : 7	Flowers_0001_154	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-12-8	For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;	1-Corinthians 12 : 8	Flowers_0001_155	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-12-9	To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;	1-Corinthians 12 : 9	Flowers_0001_156	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-12-10	To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another <i>divers</i> kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:	1-Corinthians 12 : 10	Flowers_0001_157	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-12-11	But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.	1-Corinthians 12 : 11	Flowers_0001_158	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-12-12	For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also <i>is</i> Christ.	1-Corinthians 12 : 12	Flowers_0001_159	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-12-13	For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether <i>we be</i> Jews or Gentiles, whether <i>we be</i> bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.	1-Corinthians 12 : 13	Flowers_0001_160	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-12-14	For the body is not one member, but many.	1-Corinthians 12 : 14	Flowers_0001_161	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-12-15	If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?	1-Corinthians 12 : 15	Flowers_0001_162	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-12-16	And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?	1-Corinthians 12 : 16	Flowers_0001_163	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-12-17	If the whole body <i>were</i> an eye, where <i>were</i> the hearing? If the whole <i>were</i> hearing, where <i>were</i> the smelling?	1-Corinthians 12 : 17	Flowers_0001_164	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-12-18	But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.	1-Corinthians 12 : 18	Flowers_0001_165	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-12-19	And if they were all one member, where <i>were</i> the body?	1-Corinthians 12 : 19	Flowers_0001_166	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-12-20	But now <i>are they</i> many members, yet but one body.	1-Corinthians 12 : 20	Flowers_0001_167	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-12-21	And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.	1-Corinthians 12 : 21	Flowers_0001_168	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-12-22	Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:	1-Corinthians 12 : 22	Flowers_0001_169	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-12-23	And those <i>members</i> of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely <i>parts</i> have more abundant comeliness.	1-Corinthians 12 : 23	Flowers_0001_170	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-12-24	For our comely <i>parts</i> have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that <i>part</i> which lacked:	1-Corinthians 12 : 24	Flowers_0001_171	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-12-25	That there should be no schism in the body; but <i>that</i> the members should have the same care one for another.	1-Corinthians 12 : 25	Flowers_0001_172	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-12-26	And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.	1-Corinthians 12 : 26	Flowers_0001_173	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-12-27	Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.	1-Corinthians 12 : 27	Flowers_0001_174	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-12-28	And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.	1-Corinthians 12 : 28	Flowers_0001_175	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-12-29	<i>Are</i> all apostles? <i>are</i> all prophets? <i>are</i> all teachers? <i>are</i> all workers of miracles?	1-Corinthians 12 : 29	Flowers_0001_176	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-12-30	Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?	1-Corinthians 12 : 30	Flowers_0001_177	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-12-31	But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.	1-Corinthians 12 : 31	Flowers_0001_178	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-13-1	Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become <i>as</i> sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.	1-Corinthians 13 : 1	Flowers_0001_179	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-13-2	And though I have <i>the gift of</i> prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.	1-Corinthians 13 : 2	Flowers_0001_180	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-13-3	And though I bestow all my goods to feed <i>the poor</i>, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.	1-Corinthians 13 : 3	Flowers_0001_181	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-13-4	Charity suffereth long, <i>and</i> is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,	1-Corinthians 13 : 4	Flowers_0001_182	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-13-5	Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;	1-Corinthians 13 : 5	Flowers_0001_183	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-13-6	Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;	1-Corinthians 13 : 6	Flowers_0001_184	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-13-7	Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.	1-Corinthians 13 : 7	Flowers_0001_185	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-13-8	Charity never faileth: but whether <i>there be</i> prophecies, they shall fail; whether <i>there be</i> tongues, they shall cease; whether <i>there be</i> knowledge, it shall vanish away.	1-Corinthians 13 : 8	Flowers_0001_186	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-13-9	For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.	1-Corinthians 13 : 9	Flowers_0001_187	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-13-10	But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.	1-Corinthians 13 : 10	Flowers_0001_188	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-13-11	When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.	1-Corinthians 13 : 11	Flowers_0001_189	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-13-12	For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.	1-Corinthians 13 : 12	Flowers_0001_190	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-13-13	And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these <i>is</i> charity.	1-Corinthians 13 : 13	Flowers_0001_191	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-14-1	Follow after charity, and desire spiritual <i>gifts</i>, but rather that ye may prophesy.	1-Corinthians 14 : 1	Flowers_0001_192	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-14-2	For he that speaketh in an <i>unknown</i> tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth <i>him</i>; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.	1-Corinthians 14 : 2	Flowers_0001_193	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-14-3	But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men <i>to</i> edification, and exhortation, and comfort.	1-Corinthians 14 : 3	Flowers_0001_194	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-14-4	He that speaketh in an <i>unknown</i> tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.	1-Corinthians 14 : 4	Flowers_0001_195	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-14-5	I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater <i>is</i> he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.	1-Corinthians 14 : 5	Flowers_0001_196	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-14-6	Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?	1-Corinthians 14 : 6	Flowers_0001_197	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-14-7	And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?	1-Corinthians 14 : 7	Flowers_0001_198	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-14-8	For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?	1-Corinthians 14 : 8	Flowers_0001_199	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-14-9	So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.	1-Corinthians 14 : 9	Flowers_0001_200	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-14-10	There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them <i>is</i> without signification.	1-Corinthians 14 : 10	Flowers_0001_201	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-14-11	Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh <i>shall be</i> a barbarian unto me.	1-Corinthians 14 : 11	Flowers_0001_202	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-14-12	Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual <i>gifts</i>, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.	1-Corinthians 14 : 12	Flowers_0001_203	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-14-13	Wherefore let him that speaketh in an <i>unknown</i> tongue pray that he may interpret.	1-Corinthians 14 : 13	Flowers_0001_204	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-14-14	For if I pray in an <i>unknown</i> tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.	1-Corinthians 14 : 14	Flowers_0001_205	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-14-15	What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.	1-Corinthians 14 : 15	Flowers_0001_206	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-14-16	Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?	1-Corinthians 14 : 16	Flowers_0001_207	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-14-17	For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.	1-Corinthians 14 : 17	Flowers_0001_208	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-14-18	I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:	1-Corinthians 14 : 18	Flowers_0001_209	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-14-19	Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that <i>by my voice</i> I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an <i>unknown</i> tongue.	1-Corinthians 14 : 19	Flowers_0001_210	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-14-20	Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men.	1-Corinthians 14 : 20	Flowers_0001_211	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-14-21	In the law it is written, With <i>men of</i> other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord.	1-Corinthians 14 : 21	Flowers_0001_212	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-14-22	Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying <i>serveth</i> not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.	1-Corinthians 14 : 22	Flowers_0001_213	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-14-23	If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in <i>those that are</i> unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?	1-Corinthians 14 : 23	Flowers_0001_214	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-14-24	But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or <i>one</i> unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:	1-Corinthians 14 : 24	Flowers_0001_215	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-14-25	And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on <i>his</i> face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.	1-Corinthians 14 : 25	Flowers_0001_216	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-14-26	How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.	1-Corinthians 14 : 26	Flowers_0001_217	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-14-27	If any man speak in an <i>unknown</i> tongue, <i>let it be</i> by two, or at the most <i>by</i> three, and <i>that</i> by course; and let one interpret.	1-Corinthians 14 : 27	Flowers_0001_218	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-14-28	But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.	1-Corinthians 14 : 28	Flowers_0001_219	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-14-29	Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.	1-Corinthians 14 : 29	Flowers_0001_220	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-14-30	If <i>any thing</i> be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.	1-Corinthians 14 : 30	Flowers_0001_221	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-14-31	For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.	1-Corinthians 14 : 31	Flowers_0001_222	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-14-32	And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.	1-Corinthians 14 : 32	Flowers_0001_223	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-14-33	For God is not <i>the author</i> of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.	1-Corinthians 14 : 33	Flowers_0001_224	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-14-34	Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but <i>they are commanded</i> to be under obedience, as also saith the law.	1-Corinthians 14 : 34	Flowers_0001_225	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-14-35	And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.	1-Corinthians 14 : 35	Flowers_0001_226	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-14-36	What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?	1-Corinthians 14 : 36	Flowers_0001_227	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-14-37	If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.	1-Corinthians 14 : 37	Flowers_0001_228	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-14-38	But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.	1-Corinthians 14 : 38	Flowers_0001_229	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-14-39	Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.	1-Corinthians 14 : 39	Flowers_0001_230	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-14-40	Let all things be done decently and in order.	1-Corinthians 14 : 40	Flowers_0001_231	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-15-1	Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;	1-Corinthians 15 : 1	Flowers_0001_232	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-15-2	By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.	1-Corinthians 15 : 2	Flowers_0001_233	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-15-3	For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;	1-Corinthians 15 : 3	Flowers_0001_234	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-15-4	And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:	1-Corinthians 15 : 4	Flowers_0001_235	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-15-5	And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:	1-Corinthians 15 : 5	Flowers_0001_236	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-15-6	After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep.	1-Corinthians 15 : 6	Flowers_0001_237	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-15-7	After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.	1-Corinthians 15 : 7	Flowers_0001_238	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-15-8	And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.	1-Corinthians 15 : 8	Flowers_0001_239	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-15-9	For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.	1-Corinthians 15 : 9	Flowers_0001_240	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-15-10	But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which <i>was bestowed</i> upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.	1-Corinthians 15 : 10	Flowers_0001_241	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-15-11	Therefore whether <i>it were</i> I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.	1-Corinthians 15 : 11	Flowers_0001_242	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-15-12	Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?	1-Corinthians 15 : 12	Flowers_0001_243	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-15-13	But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:	1-Corinthians 15 : 13	Flowers_0001_244	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-15-14	And if Christ be not risen, then <i>is</i> our preaching vain, and your faith <i>is</i> also vain.	1-Corinthians 15 : 14	Flowers_0001_245	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-15-15	Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.	1-Corinthians 15 : 15	Flowers_0001_246	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-15-16	For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:	1-Corinthians 15 : 16	Flowers_0001_247	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-15-17	And if Christ be not raised, your faith <i>is</i> vain; ye are yet in your sins.	1-Corinthians 15 : 17	Flowers_0001_248	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-15-18	Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.	1-Corinthians 15 : 18	Flowers_0001_249	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-15-19	If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.	1-Corinthians 15 : 19	Flowers_0001_250	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-15-20	But now is Christ risen from the dead, <i>and</i> become the firstfruits of them that slept.	1-Corinthians 15 : 20	Flowers_0001_251	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-15-21	For since by man <i>came</i> death, by man <i>came</i> also the resurrection of the dead.	1-Corinthians 15 : 21	Flowers_0001_252	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-15-22	For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.	1-Corinthians 15 : 22	Flowers_0001_253	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-15-23	But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christâ€™s at his coming.	1-Corinthians 15 : 23	Flowers_0001_254	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-15-24	Then <i>cometh</i> the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.	1-Corinthians 15 : 24	Flowers_0001_255	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-15-25	For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.	1-Corinthians 15 : 25	Flowers_0001_256	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-15-26	The last enemy <i>that</i> shall be destroyed <i>is</i> death.	1-Corinthians 15 : 26	Flowers_0001_257	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-15-27	For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith, all things are put under <i>him, it is</i> manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.	1-Corinthians 15 : 27	Flowers_0001_258	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-15-28	And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.	1-Corinthians 15 : 28	Flowers_0001_259	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-15-29	Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?	1-Corinthians 15 : 29	Flowers_0001_260	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-15-30	And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?	1-Corinthians 15 : 30	Flowers_0001_261	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-15-31	I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.	1-Corinthians 15 : 31	Flowers_0001_262	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-15-32	If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.	1-Corinthians 15 : 32	Flowers_0001_263	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-15-33	Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.	1-Corinthians 15 : 33	Flowers_0001_264	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-15-34	Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak <i>this</i> to your shame.	1-Corinthians 15 : 34	Flowers_0001_265	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-15-35	But some <i>man</i> will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?	1-Corinthians 15 : 35	Flowers_0001_266	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-15-36	<i>Thou</i> fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:	1-Corinthians 15 : 36	Flowers_0001_267	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-15-37	And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other <i>grain</i>:	1-Corinthians 15 : 37	Flowers_0001_268	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-15-38	But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed his own body.	1-Corinthians 15 : 38	Flowers_0001_269	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-15-39	All flesh <i>is</i> not the same flesh: but <i>there is</i> one <i>kind of</i> flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, <i>and</i> another of birds.	1-Corinthians 15 : 39	Flowers_0001_270	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-15-40	<i>There are</i> also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial <i>is</i> one, and the <i>glory</i> of the terrestrial <i>is</i> another.	1-Corinthians 15 : 40	Flowers_0001_271	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-15-41	<i>There is</i> one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for <i>one</i> star differeth from <i>another</i> star in glory.	1-Corinthians 15 : 41	Flowers_0001_272	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-15-42	So also <i>is</i> the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:	1-Corinthians 15 : 42	Flowers_0001_273	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-15-43	It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:	1-Corinthians 15 : 43	Flowers_0001_274	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-15-44	It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.	1-Corinthians 15 : 44	Flowers_0001_275	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-15-45	And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam <i>was made</i> a quickening spirit.	1-Corinthians 15 : 45	Flowers_0001_276	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-15-46	Howbeit that <i>was</i> not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.	1-Corinthians 15 : 46	Flowers_0001_277	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-15-47	The first man <i>is</i> of the earth, earthy: the second man <i>is</i> the Lord from heaven.	1-Corinthians 15 : 47	Flowers_0001_278	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-15-48	As <i>is</i> the earthy, such <i>are</i> they also that are earthy: and as <i>is</i> the heavenly, such <i>are</i> they also that are heavenly.	1-Corinthians 15 : 48	Flowers_0001_279	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-15-49	And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.	1-Corinthians 15 : 49	Flowers_0001_280	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-15-50	Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.	1-Corinthians 15 : 50	Flowers_0001_281	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-15-51	Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,	1-Corinthians 15 : 51	Flowers_0001_282	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-15-52	In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.	1-Corinthians 15 : 52	Flowers_0001_283	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-15-53	For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal <i>must</i> put on immortality.	1-Corinthians 15 : 53	Flowers_0001_284	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-15-54	So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.	1-Corinthians 15 : 54	Flowers_0001_285	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-15-55	O death, where <i>is</i> thy sting? O grave, where <i>is</i> thy victory?	1-Corinthians 15 : 55	Flowers_0001_286	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-15-56	The sting of death <i>is</i> sin; and the strength of sin <i>is</i> the law.	1-Corinthians 15 : 56	Flowers_0001_287	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-15-57	But thanks <i>be</i> to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.	1-Corinthians 15 : 57	Flowers_0001_288	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-15-58	Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.	1-Corinthians 15 : 58	Flowers_0001_289	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-16-1	Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.	1-Corinthians 16 : 1	Flowers_0001_290	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-16-2	Upon the first <i>day</i> of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as <i>God</i> hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.	1-Corinthians 16 : 2	Flowers_0001_291	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-16-3	And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by <i>your</i> letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.	1-Corinthians 16 : 3	Flowers_0001_292	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-16-4	And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.	1-Corinthians 16 : 4	Flowers_0001_293	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-16-5	Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.	1-Corinthians 16 : 5	Flowers_0001_294	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-16-6	And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.	1-Corinthians 16 : 6	Flowers_0001_295	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-16-7	For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.	1-Corinthians 16 : 7	Flowers_0001_296	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-16-8	But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.	1-Corinthians 16 : 8	Flowers_0001_297	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-16-9	For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and <i>there are</i> many adversaries.	1-Corinthians 16 : 9	Flowers_0001_298	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-16-10	Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also <i>do</i>.	1-Corinthians 16 : 10	Flowers_0001_299	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-16-11	Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.	1-Corinthians 16 : 11	Flowers_0001_300	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-16-12	As touching <i>our</i> brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.	1-Corinthians 16 : 12	Flowers_0001_301	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-16-13	Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.	1-Corinthians 16 : 13	Flowers_0001_302	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-16-14	Let all your things be done with charity.	1-Corinthians 16 : 14	Flowers_0001_303	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-16-15	I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and <i>that</i> they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)	1-Corinthians 16 : 15	Flowers_0001_304	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-16-16	That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with <i>us</i>, and laboureth.	1-Corinthians 16 : 16	Flowers_0001_305	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-16-17	I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.	1-Corinthians 16 : 17	Flowers_0001_306	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-16-18	For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.	1-Corinthians 16 : 18	Flowers_0001_307	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-16-19	The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.	1-Corinthians 16 : 19	Flowers_0001_308	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-16-20	All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.	1-Corinthians 16 : 20	Flowers_0001_309	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-16-21	The salutation of <i>me</i> Paul with mine own hand.	1-Corinthians 16 : 21	Flowers_0001_310	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-16-22	If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.	1-Corinthians 16 : 22	Flowers_0001_311	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-16-23	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with you.	1-Corinthians 16 : 23	Flowers_0001_312	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-16-24	My love <i>be</i> with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen. 	1-Corinthians 16 : 24	Flowers_0001_313	bgc-0014
2-Corinthians-1-1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy <i>our</i> brother, unto the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints which are in all Achaia:	2-Corinthians 1 : 1	Flowers_0001_314	bgc-0015
2-Corinthians-1-2	Grace <i>be</i> to you and peace from God our Father, and <i>from</i> the Lord Jesus Christ.	2-Corinthians 1 : 2	Flowers_0001_315	bgc-0016
2-Corinthians-1-3	Blessed <i>be</i> God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;	2-Corinthians 1 : 3	Flowers_0001_316	bgc-0003
2-Corinthians-1-4	Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.	2-Corinthians 1 : 4	Flowers_0001_317	bgc-0004
2-Corinthians-1-5	For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.	2-Corinthians 1 : 5	Flowers_0001_318	bgc-0005
2-Corinthians-1-6	And whether we be afflicted, <i>it is</i> for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, <i>it is</i> for your consolation and salvation.	2-Corinthians 1 : 6	Flowers_0001_319	bgc-0006
2-Corinthians-1-7	And our hope of you <i>is</i> stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so <i>shall ye be</i> also of the consolation.	2-Corinthians 1 : 7	Flowers_0001_320	bgc-0007
2-Corinthians-1-8	For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life:	2-Corinthians 1 : 8	Flowers_0001_321	bgc-0008
2-Corinthians-1-9	But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:	2-Corinthians 1 : 9	Flowers_0001_322	bgc-0009
2-Corinthians-1-10	Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver <i>us</i>;	2-Corinthians 1 : 10	Flowers_0001_323	bgc-0010
2-Corinthians-1-11	Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift <i>bestowed</i> upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf.	2-Corinthians 1 : 11	Flowers_0001_324	bgc-0011
2-Corinthians-1-12	For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.	2-Corinthians 1 : 12	Flowers_0001_325	bgc-0012
2-Corinthians-1-13	For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye shall acknowledge even to the end;	2-Corinthians 1 : 13	Flowers_0001_326	bgc-0013
2-Corinthians-1-14	As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also <i>are</i> ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.	2-Corinthians 1 : 14	Flowers_0001_327	bgc-0014
2-Corinthians-1-15	And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit;	2-Corinthians 1 : 15	Flowers_0001_328	bgc-0015
2-Corinthians-1-16	And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea.	2-Corinthians 1 : 16	Flowers_0001_329	bgc-0016
2-Corinthians-1-17	When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?	2-Corinthians 1 : 17	Flowers_0001_330	bgc-0003
2-Corinthians-1-18	But <i>as</i> God <i>is</i> true, our word toward you was not yea and nay.	2-Corinthians 1 : 18	Flowers_0001_331	bgc-0004
2-Corinthians-1-19	For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, <i>even</i> by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.	2-Corinthians 1 : 19	Flowers_0001_332	bgc-0005
2-Corinthians-1-20	For all the promises of God in him <i>are</i> yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us.	2-Corinthians 1 : 20	Flowers_0001_333	bgc-0006
2-Corinthians-1-21	Now he which stablisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, <i>is</i> God;	2-Corinthians 1 : 21	Flowers_0001_334	bgc-0007
2-Corinthians-1-22	Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.	2-Corinthians 1 : 22	Flowers_0001_335	bgc-0008
2-Corinthians-1-23	Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth.	2-Corinthians 1 : 23	Flowers_0001_336	bgc-0009
2-Corinthians-1-24	Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.	2-Corinthians 1 : 24	Flowers_0001_337	bgc-0010
2-Corinthians-2-1	But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.	2-Corinthians 2 : 1	Flowers_0001_338	bgc-0011
2-Corinthians-2-2	For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?	2-Corinthians 2 : 2	Flowers_0001_339	bgc-0012
2-Corinthians-2-3	And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is <i>the joy</i> of you all.	2-Corinthians 2 : 3	Flowers_0001_340	bgc-0013
2-Corinthians-2-4	For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.	2-Corinthians 2 : 4	Flowers_0001_341	bgc-0014
2-Corinthians-2-5	But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.	2-Corinthians 2 : 5	Flowers_0001_342	bgc-0015
2-Corinthians-2-6	Sufficient to such a man <i>is</i> this punishment, which <i>was inflicted</i> of many.	2-Corinthians 2 : 6	Flowers_0001_343	bgc-0016
2-Corinthians-2-7	So that contrariwise ye <i>ought</i> rather to forgive <i>him</i>, and comfort <i>him</i>, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.	2-Corinthians 2 : 7	Flowers_0001_1	bgc-0003
2-Corinthians-2-8	Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm <i>your</i> love toward him.	2-Corinthians 2 : 8	Flowers_0001_1	bgc-0003
2-Corinthians-2-9	For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.	2-Corinthians 2 : 9	Flowers_0001_2	bgc-0004
2-Corinthians-2-10	To whom ye forgive any thing, I <i>forgive</i> also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave <i>it</i>, for your sakes <i>forgave I it</i> in the person of Christ;	2-Corinthians 2 : 10	Flowers_0001_3	bgc-0005
2-Corinthians-2-11	Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.	2-Corinthians 2 : 11	Flowers_0001_4	bgc-0006
2-Corinthians-2-12	Furthermore, when I came to Troas to <i>preach</i> Christâ€™s gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,	2-Corinthians 2 : 12	Flowers_0001_5	bgc-0007
2-Corinthians-2-13	I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.	2-Corinthians 2 : 13	Flowers_0001_6	bgc-0008
2-Corinthians-2-14	Now thanks <i>be</i> unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.	2-Corinthians 2 : 14	Flowers_0001_7	bgc-0009
2-Corinthians-2-15	For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:	2-Corinthians 2 : 15	Flowers_0001_8	bgc-0010
2-Corinthians-2-16	To the one <i>we are</i> the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who <i>is</i> sufficient for these things?	2-Corinthians 2 : 16	Flowers_0001_9	bgc-0011
2-Corinthians-2-17	For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.	2-Corinthians 2 : 17	Flowers_0001_10	bgc-0012
2-Corinthians-3-1	Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some <i>others</i>, epistles of commendation to you, or <i>letters</i> of commendation from you?	2-Corinthians 3 : 1	Flowers_0001_11	bgc-0013
2-Corinthians-3-2	Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:	2-Corinthians 3 : 2	Flowers_0001_12	bgc-0014
2-Corinthians-3-3	<i>Forasmuch as ye are</i> manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.	2-Corinthians 3 : 3	Flowers_0001_13	bgc-0015
2-Corinthians-3-4	And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:	2-Corinthians 3 : 4	Flowers_0001_14	bgc-0016
2-Corinthians-3-5	Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency <i>is</i> of God;	2-Corinthians 3 : 5	Flowers_0001_15	bgc-0003
2-Corinthians-3-6	Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life.	2-Corinthians 3 : 6	Flowers_0001_16	bgc-0004
2-Corinthians-3-7	But if the ministration of death, written <i>and</i> engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance; which <i>glory</i> was to be done away:	2-Corinthians 3 : 7	Flowers_0001_17	bgc-0005
2-Corinthians-3-8	How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?	2-Corinthians 3 : 8	Flowers_0001_18	bgc-0006
2-Corinthians-3-9	For if the ministration of condemnation <i>be</i> glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.	2-Corinthians 3 : 9	Flowers_0001_19	bgc-0007
2-Corinthians-3-10	For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.	2-Corinthians 3 : 10	Flowers_0001_20	bgc-0008
2-Corinthians-3-11	For if that which is done away <i>was</i> glorious, much more that which remaineth <i>is</i> glorious.	2-Corinthians 3 : 11	Flowers_0001_21	bgc-0009
2-Corinthians-3-12	Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:	2-Corinthians 3 : 12	Flowers_0001_22	bgc-0010
2-Corinthians-3-13	And not as Moses, <i>which</i> put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:	2-Corinthians 3 : 13	Flowers_0001_23	bgc-0011
2-Corinthians-3-14	But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which <i>vail</i> is done away in Christ.	2-Corinthians 3 : 14	Flowers_0001_24	bgc-0012
2-Corinthians-3-15	But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart.	2-Corinthians 3 : 15	Flowers_0001_25	bgc-0013
2-Corinthians-3-16	Nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken away.	2-Corinthians 3 : 16	Flowers_0001_26	bgc-0014
2-Corinthians-3-17	Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord <i>is</i>, there <i>is</i> liberty.	2-Corinthians 3 : 17	Flowers_0001_27	bgc-0015
2-Corinthians-3-18	But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, <i>even</i> as by the Spirit of the Lord.	2-Corinthians 3 : 18	Flowers_0001_28	bgc-0016
2-Corinthians-4-1	Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;	2-Corinthians 4 : 1	Flowers_0001_29	bgc-0003
2-Corinthians-4-2	But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every manâ€™s conscience in the sight of God.	2-Corinthians 4 : 2	Flowers_0001_30	bgc-0004
2-Corinthians-4-3	But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:	2-Corinthians 4 : 3	Flowers_0001_31	bgc-0005
2-Corinthians-4-4	In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.	2-Corinthians 4 : 4	Flowers_0001_32	bgc-0006
2-Corinthians-4-5	For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesusâ€™ sake.	2-Corinthians 4 : 5	Flowers_0001_33	bgc-0007
2-Corinthians-4-6	For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to <i>give</i> the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.	2-Corinthians 4 : 6	Flowers_0001_34	bgc-0008
2-Corinthians-4-7	But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us.	2-Corinthians 4 : 7	Flowers_0001_35	bgc-0009
2-Corinthians-4-8	<i>We are</i> troubled on every side, yet not distressed; <i>we are</i> perplexed, but not in despair;	2-Corinthians 4 : 8	Flowers_0001_36	bgc-0010
2-Corinthians-4-9	Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;	2-Corinthians 4 : 9	Flowers_0001_37	bgc-0011
2-Corinthians-4-10	Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.	2-Corinthians 4 : 10	Flowers_0001_38	bgc-0012
2-Corinthians-4-11	For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesusâ€™ sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.	2-Corinthians 4 : 11	Flowers_0001_39	bgc-0013
2-Corinthians-4-12	So then death worketh in us, but life in you.	2-Corinthians 4 : 12	Flowers_0001_40	bgc-0014
2-Corinthians-4-13	We having the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken; we also believe, and therefore speak;	2-Corinthians 4 : 13	Flowers_0001_41	bgc-0015
2-Corinthians-4-14	Knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus, and shall present <i>us</i> with you.	2-Corinthians 4 : 14	Flowers_0001_42	bgc-0016
2-Corinthians-4-15	For all things <i>are</i> for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redound to the glory of God.	2-Corinthians 4 : 15	Flowers_0001_43	bgc-0003
2-Corinthians-4-16	For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward <i>man</i> is renewed day by day.	2-Corinthians 4 : 16	Flowers_0001_44	bgc-0004
2-Corinthians-4-17	For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding <i>and</i> eternal weight of glory;	2-Corinthians 4 : 17	Flowers_0001_45	bgc-0005
2-Corinthians-4-18	While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen <i>are</i> temporal; but the things which are not seen <i>are</i> eternal.	2-Corinthians 4 : 18	Flowers_0001_46	bgc-0006
2-Corinthians-5-1	For we know that if our earthly house of <i>this</i> tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.	2-Corinthians 5 : 1	Flowers_0001_47	bgc-0007
2-Corinthians-5-2	For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:	2-Corinthians 5 : 2	Flowers_0001_48	bgc-0008
2-Corinthians-5-3	If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.	2-Corinthians 5 : 3	Flowers_0001_49	bgc-0009
2-Corinthians-5-4	For we that are in <i>this</i> tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.	2-Corinthians 5 : 4	Flowers_0001_50	bgc-0010
2-Corinthians-5-5	Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing <i>is</i> God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.	2-Corinthians 5 : 5	Flowers_0001_51	bgc-0011
2-Corinthians-5-6	Therefore <i>we are</i> always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:	2-Corinthians 5 : 6	Flowers_0001_52	bgc-0012
2-Corinthians-5-7	(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)	2-Corinthians 5 : 7	Flowers_0001_53	bgc-0013
2-Corinthians-5-8	We are confident, <i>I say</i>, and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.	2-Corinthians 5 : 8	Flowers_0001_54	bgc-0014
2-Corinthians-5-9	Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.	2-Corinthians 5 : 9	Flowers_0001_55	bgc-0015
2-Corinthians-5-10	For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things <i>done</i> in <i>his</i> body, according to that he hath done, whether <i>it be</i> good or bad.	2-Corinthians 5 : 10	Flowers_0001_56	bgc-0016
2-Corinthians-5-11	Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.	2-Corinthians 5 : 11	Flowers_0001_57	bgc-0003
2-Corinthians-5-12	For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to <i>answer</i> them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.	2-Corinthians 5 : 12	Flowers_0001_58	bgc-0004
2-Corinthians-5-13	For whether we be beside ourselves, <i>it is</i> to God: or whether we be sober, <i>it is</i> for your cause.	2-Corinthians 5 : 13	Flowers_0001_59	bgc-0005
2-Corinthians-5-14	For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:	2-Corinthians 5 : 14	Flowers_0001_60	bgc-0006
2-Corinthians-5-15	And <i>that</i> he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.	2-Corinthians 5 : 15	Flowers_0001_61	bgc-0007
2-Corinthians-5-16	Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we <i>him</i> no more.	2-Corinthians 5 : 16	Flowers_0001_62	bgc-0008
2-Corinthians-5-17	Therefore if any man <i>be</i> in Christ, <i>he is</i> a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.	2-Corinthians 5 : 17	Flowers_0001_63	bgc-0009
2-Corinthians-5-18	And all things <i>are</i> of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;	2-Corinthians 5 : 18	Flowers_0001_64	bgc-0010
2-Corinthians-5-19	To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.	2-Corinthians 5 : 19	Flowers_0001_65	bgc-0011
2-Corinthians-5-20	Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech <i>you</i> by us: we pray <i>you</i> in Christâ€™s stead, be ye reconciled to God.	2-Corinthians 5 : 20	Flowers_0001_66	bgc-0012
2-Corinthians-5-21	For he hath made him <i>to be</i> sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.	2-Corinthians 5 : 21	Flowers_0001_67	bgc-0013
2-Corinthians-6-1	We then, <i>as</i> workers together <i>with him</i>, beseech <i>you</i> also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.	2-Corinthians 6 : 1	Flowers_0001_68	bgc-0014
2-Corinthians-6-2	(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now <i>is</i> the accepted time; behold, now <i>is</i> the day of salvation.)	2-Corinthians 6 : 2	Flowers_0001_69	bgc-0015
2-Corinthians-6-3	Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:	2-Corinthians 6 : 3	Flowers_0001_70	bgc-0016
2-Corinthians-6-4	But in all <i>things</i> approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,	2-Corinthians 6 : 4	Flowers_0001_71	bgc-0003
2-Corinthians-6-5	In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;	2-Corinthians 6 : 5	Flowers_0001_72	bgc-0004
2-Corinthians-6-6	By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,	2-Corinthians 6 : 6	Flowers_0001_73	bgc-0005
2-Corinthians-6-7	By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,	2-Corinthians 6 : 7	Flowers_0001_74	bgc-0006
2-Corinthians-6-8	By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and <i>yet</i> true;	2-Corinthians 6 : 8	Flowers_0001_75	bgc-0007
2-Corinthians-6-9	As unknown, and <i>yet</i> well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;	2-Corinthians 6 : 9	Flowers_0001_76	bgc-0008
2-Corinthians-6-10	As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and <i>yet</i> possessing all things.	2-Corinthians 6 : 10	Flowers_0001_77	bgc-0009
2-Corinthians-6-11	O <i>ye</i> Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.	2-Corinthians 6 : 11	Flowers_0001_78	bgc-0010
2-Corinthians-6-12	Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.	2-Corinthians 6 : 12	Flowers_0001_79	bgc-0011
2-Corinthians-6-13	Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto <i>my</i> children,) be ye also enlarged.	2-Corinthians 6 : 13	Flowers_0001_80	bgc-0012
2-Corinthians-6-14	Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?	2-Corinthians 6 : 14	Flowers_0001_81	bgc-0013
2-Corinthians-6-15	And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?	2-Corinthians 6 : 15	Flowers_0001_82	bgc-0014
2-Corinthians-6-16	And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in <i>them</i>; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.	2-Corinthians 6 : 16	Flowers_0001_83	bgc-0015
2-Corinthians-6-17	Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean <i>thing</i>; and I will receive you,	2-Corinthians 6 : 17	Flowers_0001_84	bgc-0016
2-Corinthians-6-18	And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.	2-Corinthians 6 : 18	Flowers_0001_85	bgc-0003
2-Corinthians-7-1	Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.	2-Corinthians 7 : 1	Flowers_0001_86	bgc-0004
2-Corinthians-7-2	Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.	2-Corinthians 7 : 2	Flowers_0001_87	bgc-0005
2-Corinthians-7-3	I speak not <i>this</i> to condemn <i>you</i>: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with <i>you</i>.	2-Corinthians 7 : 3	Flowers_0001_88	bgc-0006
2-Corinthians-7-4	Great <i>is</i> my boldness of speech toward you, great <i>is</i> my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.	2-Corinthians 7 : 4	Flowers_0001_89	bgc-0007
2-Corinthians-7-5	For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without <i>were</i> fightings, within <i>were</i> fears.	2-Corinthians 7 : 5	Flowers_0001_90	bgc-0008
2-Corinthians-7-6	Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;	2-Corinthians 7 : 6	Flowers_0001_91	bgc-0009
2-Corinthians-7-7	And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.	2-Corinthians 7 : 7	Flowers_0001_92	bgc-0010
2-Corinthians-7-8	For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though <i>it were</i> but for a season.	2-Corinthians 7 : 8	Flowers_0001_93	bgc-0011
2-Corinthians-7-9	Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive damage by us in nothing.	2-Corinthians 7 : 9	Flowers_0001_94	bgc-0012
2-Corinthians-7-10	For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.	2-Corinthians 7 : 10	Flowers_0001_95	bgc-0013
2-Corinthians-7-11	For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, <i>what</i> clearing of yourselves, yea, <i>what</i> indignation, yea, <i>what</i> fear, yea, <i>what</i> vehement desire, yea, <i>what</i> zeal, yea, <i>what</i> revenge! In all <i>things</i> ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.	2-Corinthians 7 : 11	Flowers_0001_96	bgc-0014
2-Corinthians-7-12	Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, <i>I did it</i> not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.	2-Corinthians 7 : 12	Flowers_0001_97	bgc-0015
2-Corinthians-7-13	Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.	2-Corinthians 7 : 13	Flowers_0001_98	bgc-0016
2-Corinthians-7-14	For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which <i>I made</i> before Titus, is found a truth.	2-Corinthians 7 : 14	Flowers_0001_99	bgc-0003
2-Corinthians-7-15	And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.	2-Corinthians 7 : 15	Flowers_0001_100	bgc-0004
2-Corinthians-7-16	I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all <i>things</i>.	2-Corinthians 7 : 16	Flowers_0001_101	bgc-0005
2-Corinthians-8-1	Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;	2-Corinthians 8 : 1	Flowers_0001_102	bgc-0006
2-Corinthians-8-2	How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.	2-Corinthians 8 : 2	Flowers_0001_103	bgc-0007
2-Corinthians-8-3	For to <i>their</i> power, I bear record, yea, and beyond <i>their</i> power <i>they were</i> willing of themselves;	2-Corinthians 8 : 3	Flowers_0001_104	bgc-0008
2-Corinthians-8-4	Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and <i>take upon us</i> the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.	2-Corinthians 8 : 4	Flowers_0001_105	bgc-0009
2-Corinthians-8-5	And <i>this they did</i>, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.	2-Corinthians 8 : 5	Flowers_0001_106	bgc-0010
2-Corinthians-8-6	Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.	2-Corinthians 8 : 6	Flowers_0001_107	bgc-0011
2-Corinthians-8-7	Therefore, as ye abound in every <i>thing, in</i> faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and <i>in</i> all diligence, and <i>in</i> your love to us, <i>see</i> that ye abound in this grace also.	2-Corinthians 8 : 7	Flowers_0001_108	bgc-0012
2-Corinthians-8-8	I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.	2-Corinthians 8 : 8	Flowers_0001_109	bgc-0013
2-Corinthians-8-9	For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.	2-Corinthians 8 : 9	Flowers_0001_110	bgc-0014
2-Corinthians-8-10	And herein I give <i>my</i> advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.	2-Corinthians 8 : 10	Flowers_0001_111	bgc-0015
2-Corinthians-8-11	Now therefore perform the doing <i>of it</i>; that as <i>there was</i> a readiness to will, so <i>there may be</i> a performance also out of that which ye have.	2-Corinthians 8 : 11	Flowers_0001_112	bgc-0016
2-Corinthians-8-12	For if there be first a willing mind, <i>it is</i> accepted according to that a man hath, <i>and</i> not according to that he hath not.	2-Corinthians 8 : 12	Flowers_0001_113	bgc-0003
2-Corinthians-8-13	For <i>I mean</i> not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:	2-Corinthians 8 : 13	Flowers_0001_114	bgc-0004
2-Corinthians-8-14	But by an equality, <i>that</i> now at this time your abundance <i>may be a supply</i> for their want, that their abundance also may be <i>a supply</i> for your want: that there may be equality:	2-Corinthians 8 : 14	Flowers_0001_115	bgc-0005
2-Corinthians-8-15	As it is written, He that <i>had gathered</i> much had nothing over; and he that <i>had gathered</i> little had no lack.	2-Corinthians 8 : 15	Flowers_0001_116	bgc-0006
2-Corinthians-8-16	But thanks <i>be</i> to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.	2-Corinthians 8 : 16	Flowers_0001_117	bgc-0007
2-Corinthians-8-17	For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.	2-Corinthians 8 : 17	Flowers_0001_118	bgc-0008
2-Corinthians-8-18	And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise <i>is</i> in the gospel throughout all the churches;	2-Corinthians 8 : 18	Flowers_0001_119	bgc-0009
2-Corinthians-8-19	And not <i>that</i> only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and <i>declaration of</i> your ready mind:	2-Corinthians 8 : 19	Flowers_0001_120	bgc-0010
2-Corinthians-8-20	Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:	2-Corinthians 8 : 20	Flowers_0001_121	bgc-0011
2-Corinthians-8-21	Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.	2-Corinthians 8 : 21	Flowers_0001_122	bgc-0012
2-Corinthians-8-22	And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which <i>I have</i> in you.	2-Corinthians 8 : 22	Flowers_0001_123	bgc-0013
2-Corinthians-8-23	Whether <i>any do inquire</i> of Titus, <i>he is</i> my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren <i>be inquired of, they are</i> the messengers of the churches, <i>and</i> the glory of Christ.	2-Corinthians 8 : 23	Flowers_0001_124	bgc-0014
2-Corinthians-8-24	Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.	2-Corinthians 8 : 24	Flowers_0001_125	bgc-0015
2-Corinthians-9-1	For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:	2-Corinthians 9 : 1	Flowers_0001_126	bgc-0016
2-Corinthians-9-2	For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.	2-Corinthians 9 : 2	Flowers_0001_127	bgc-0003
2-Corinthians-9-3	Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:	2-Corinthians 9 : 3	Flowers_0001_128	bgc-0004
2-Corinthians-9-4	Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.	2-Corinthians 9 : 4	Flowers_0001_129	bgc-0005
2-Corinthians-9-5	Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as <i>a matter of</i> bounty, and not as <i>of</i> covetousness.	2-Corinthians 9 : 5	Flowers_0001_130	bgc-0006
2-Corinthians-9-6	But this <i>I say</i>, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.	2-Corinthians 9 : 6	Flowers_0001_131	bgc-0007
2-Corinthians-9-7	Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, <i>so let him give</i>; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.	2-Corinthians 9 : 7	Flowers_0001_132	bgc-0008
2-Corinthians-9-8	And God <i>is</i> able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all <i>things</i>, may abound to every good work:	2-Corinthians 9 : 8	Flowers_0001_133	bgc-0009
2-Corinthians-9-9	As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.	2-Corinthians 9 : 9	Flowers_0001_134	bgc-0010
2-Corinthians-9-10	Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for <i>your</i> food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;	2-Corinthians 9 : 10	Flowers_0001_135	bgc-0011
2-Corinthians-9-11	Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.	2-Corinthians 9 : 11	Flowers_0001_136	bgc-0012
2-Corinthians-9-12	For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;	2-Corinthians 9 : 12	Flowers_0001_137	bgc-0013
2-Corinthians-9-13	Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for <i>your</i> liberal distribution unto them, and unto all <i>men</i>;	2-Corinthians 9 : 13	Flowers_0001_138	bgc-0014
2-Corinthians-9-14	And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.	2-Corinthians 9 : 14	Flowers_0001_139	bgc-0015
2-Corinthians-9-15	Thanks <i>be</i> unto God for his unspeakable gift.	2-Corinthians 9 : 15	Flowers_0001_140	bgc-0016
2-Corinthians-10-1	Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence <i>am</i> base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:	2-Corinthians 10 : 1	Flowers_0001_141	bgc-0003
2-Corinthians-10-2	But I beseech <i>you</i>, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.	2-Corinthians 10 : 2	Flowers_0001_142	bgc-0004
2-Corinthians-10-3	For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:	2-Corinthians 10 : 3	Flowers_0001_143	bgc-0005
2-Corinthians-10-4	(For the weapons of our warfare <i>are</i> not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)	2-Corinthians 10 : 4	Flowers_0001_144	bgc-0006
2-Corinthians-10-5	Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;	2-Corinthians 10 : 5	Flowers_0001_145	bgc-0007
2-Corinthians-10-6	And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.	2-Corinthians 10 : 6	Flowers_0001_146	bgc-0008
2-Corinthians-10-7	Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christâ€™s, let him of himself think this again, that, as he <i>is</i> Christâ€™s, even so <i>are</i> we Christâ€™s.	2-Corinthians 10 : 7	Flowers_0001_147	bgc-0009
2-Corinthians-10-8	For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:	2-Corinthians 10 : 8	Flowers_0001_148	bgc-0010
2-Corinthians-10-9	That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.	2-Corinthians 10 : 9	Flowers_0001_149	bgc-0011
2-Corinthians-10-10	For <i>his</i> letters, say they, <i>are</i> weighty and powerful; but <i>his</i> bodily presence <i>is</i> weak, and <i>his</i> speech contemptible.	2-Corinthians 10 : 10	Flowers_0001_150	bgc-0012
2-Corinthians-10-11	Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such <i>will we be</i> also in deed when we are present.	2-Corinthians 10 : 11	Flowers_0001_151	bgc-0013
2-Corinthians-10-12	For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.	2-Corinthians 10 : 12	Flowers_0001_152	bgc-0014
2-Corinthians-10-13	But we will not boast of things without <i>our</i> measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.	2-Corinthians 10 : 13	Flowers_0001_153	bgc-0015
2-Corinthians-10-14	For we stretch not ourselves beyond <i>our measure</i>, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in <i>preaching</i> the gospel of Christ:	2-Corinthians 10 : 14	Flowers_0001_154	bgc-0016
2-Corinthians-10-15	Not boasting of things without <i>our</i> measure, <i>that is</i>, of other menâ€™s labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,	2-Corinthians 10 : 15	Flowers_0001_155	bgc-0003
2-Corinthians-10-16	To preach the gospel in the <i>regions</i> beyond you, <i>and</i> not to boast in another manâ€™s line of things made ready to our hand.	2-Corinthians 10 : 16	Flowers_0001_156	bgc-0004
2-Corinthians-10-17	But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.	2-Corinthians 10 : 17	Flowers_0001_157	bgc-0005
2-Corinthians-10-18	For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.	2-Corinthians 10 : 18	Flowers_0001_158	bgc-0006
2-Corinthians-11-1	Would to God ye could bear with me a little in <i>my</i> folly: and indeed bear with me.	2-Corinthians 11 : 1	Flowers_0001_159	bgc-0007
2-Corinthians-11-2	For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present <i>you as</i> a chaste virgin to Christ.	2-Corinthians 11 : 2	Flowers_0001_160	bgc-0008
2-Corinthians-11-3	But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.	2-Corinthians 11 : 3	Flowers_0001_161	bgc-0009
2-Corinthians-11-4	For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or <i>if</i> ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with <i>him</i>.	2-Corinthians 11 : 4	Flowers_0001_162	bgc-0010
2-Corinthians-11-5	For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.	2-Corinthians 11 : 5	Flowers_0001_163	bgc-0011
2-Corinthians-11-6	But though <i>I be</i> rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.	2-Corinthians 11 : 6	Flowers_0001_164	bgc-0012
2-Corinthians-11-7	Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?	2-Corinthians 11 : 7	Flowers_0001_165	bgc-0013
2-Corinthians-11-8	I robbed other churches, taking wages <i>of them</i>, to do you service.	2-Corinthians 11 : 8	Flowers_0001_166	bgc-0014
2-Corinthians-11-9	And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all <i>things</i> I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and <i>so</i> will I keep <i>myself</i>.	2-Corinthians 11 : 9	Flowers_0001_167	bgc-0015
2-Corinthians-11-10	As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.	2-Corinthians 11 : 10	Flowers_0001_168	bgc-0016
2-Corinthians-11-11	Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.	2-Corinthians 11 : 11	Flowers_0001_169	bgc-0003
2-Corinthians-11-12	But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.	2-Corinthians 11 : 12	Flowers_0001_170	bgc-0004
2-Corinthians-11-13	For such <i>are</i> false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.	2-Corinthians 11 : 13	Flowers_0001_171	bgc-0005
2-Corinthians-11-14	And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.	2-Corinthians 11 : 14	Flowers_0001_172	bgc-0006
2-Corinthians-11-15	Therefore <i>it is</i> no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.	2-Corinthians 11 : 15	Flowers_0001_173	bgc-0007
2-Corinthians-11-16	I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.	2-Corinthians 11 : 16	Flowers_0001_174	bgc-0008
2-Corinthians-11-17	That which I speak, I speak <i>it</i> not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.	2-Corinthians 11 : 17	Flowers_0001_175	bgc-0009
2-Corinthians-11-18	Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.	2-Corinthians 11 : 18	Flowers_0001_176	bgc-0010
2-Corinthians-11-19	For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye <i>yourselves</i> are wise.	2-Corinthians 11 : 19	Flowers_0001_177	bgc-0011
2-Corinthians-11-20	For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour <i>you</i>, if a man take <i>of you</i>, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.	2-Corinthians 11 : 20	Flowers_0001_178	bgc-0012
2-Corinthians-11-21	I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.	2-Corinthians 11 : 21	Flowers_0001_179	bgc-0013
2-Corinthians-11-22	Are they Hebrews? so <i>am</i> I. Are they Israelites? so <i>am</i> I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so <i>am</i> I.	2-Corinthians 11 : 22	Flowers_0001_180	bgc-0014
2-Corinthians-11-23	Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I <i>am</i> more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.	2-Corinthians 11 : 23	Flowers_0001_181	bgc-0015
2-Corinthians-11-24	Of the Jews five times received I forty <i>stripes</i> save one.	2-Corinthians 11 : 24	Flowers_0001_182	bgc-0016
2-Corinthians-11-25	Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;	2-Corinthians 11 : 25	Flowers_0001_183	bgc-0003
2-Corinthians-11-26	<i>In</i> journeyings often, <i>in</i> perils of waters, <i>in</i> perils of robbers, <i>in</i> perils by <i>mine own</i> countrymen, <i>in</i> perils by the heathen, <i>in</i> perils in the city, <i>in</i> perils in the wilderness, <i>in</i> perils in the sea, <i>in</i> perils among false brethren;	2-Corinthians 11 : 26	Flowers_0001_184	bgc-0004
2-Corinthians-11-27	In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.	2-Corinthians 11 : 27	Flowers_0001_185	bgc-0005
2-Corinthians-11-28	Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.	2-Corinthians 11 : 28	Flowers_0001_186	bgc-0006
2-Corinthians-11-29	Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?	2-Corinthians 11 : 29	Flowers_0001_187	bgc-0007
2-Corinthians-11-30	If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.	2-Corinthians 11 : 30	Flowers_0001_188	bgc-0008
2-Corinthians-11-31	The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.	2-Corinthians 11 : 31	Flowers_0001_189	bgc-0009
2-Corinthians-11-32	In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:	2-Corinthians 11 : 32	Flowers_0001_190	bgc-0010
2-Corinthians-11-33	And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.	2-Corinthians 11 : 33	Flowers_0001_191	bgc-0011
2-Corinthians-12-1	It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.	2-Corinthians 12 : 1	Flowers_0001_192	bgc-0012
2-Corinthians-12-2	I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.	2-Corinthians 12 : 2	Flowers_0001_193	bgc-0013
2-Corinthians-12-3	And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)	2-Corinthians 12 : 3	Flowers_0001_194	bgc-0014
2-Corinthians-12-4	How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.	2-Corinthians 12 : 4	Flowers_0001_195	bgc-0015
2-Corinthians-12-5	Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.	2-Corinthians 12 : 5	Flowers_0001_196	bgc-0016
2-Corinthians-12-6	For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but <i>now</i> I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me <i>to be</i>, or <i>that</i> he heareth of me.	2-Corinthians 12 : 6	Flowers_0001_197	bgc-0003
2-Corinthians-12-7	And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.	2-Corinthians 12 : 7	Flowers_0001_198	bgc-0004
2-Corinthians-12-8	For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.	2-Corinthians 12 : 8	Flowers_0001_199	bgc-0005
2-Corinthians-12-9	And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.	2-Corinthians 12 : 9	Flowers_0001_200	bgc-0006
2-Corinthians-12-10	Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christâ€™s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.	2-Corinthians 12 : 10	Flowers_0001_201	bgc-0007
2-Corinthians-12-11	I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.	2-Corinthians 12 : 11	Flowers_0001_202	bgc-0008
2-Corinthians-12-12	Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.	2-Corinthians 12 : 12	Flowers_0001_203	bgc-0009
2-Corinthians-12-13	For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except <i>it be</i> that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.	2-Corinthians 12 : 13	Flowers_0001_204	bgc-0010
2-Corinthians-12-14	Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.	2-Corinthians 12 : 14	Flowers_0001_205	bgc-0011
2-Corinthians-12-15	And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.	2-Corinthians 12 : 15	Flowers_0001_206	bgc-0012
2-Corinthians-12-16	But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.	2-Corinthians 12 : 16	Flowers_0001_207	bgc-0013
2-Corinthians-12-17	Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?	2-Corinthians 12 : 17	Flowers_0001_208	bgc-0014
2-Corinthians-12-18	I desired Titus, and with <i>him</i> I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? <i>walked we</i> not in the same steps?	2-Corinthians 12 : 18	Flowers_0001_209	bgc-0015
2-Corinthians-12-19	Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but <i>we do</i> all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.	2-Corinthians 12 : 19	Flowers_0001_210	bgc-0016
2-Corinthians-12-20	For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and <i>that</i> I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest <i>there be</i> debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:	2-Corinthians 12 : 20	Flowers_0001_211	bgc-0003
2-Corinthians-12-21	<i>And</i> lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and <i>that</i> I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.	2-Corinthians 12 : 21	Flowers_0001_212	bgc-0004
2-Corinthians-13-1	This <i>is</i> the third <i>time</i> I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.	2-Corinthians 13 : 1	Flowers_0001_213	bgc-0005
2-Corinthians-13-2	I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:	2-Corinthians 13 : 2	Flowers_0001_214	bgc-0006
2-Corinthians-13-3	Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.	2-Corinthians 13 : 3	Flowers_0001_215	bgc-0007
2-Corinthians-13-4	For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.	2-Corinthians 13 : 4	Flowers_0001_216	bgc-0008
2-Corinthians-13-5	Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?	2-Corinthians 13 : 5	Flowers_0001_217	bgc-0009
2-Corinthians-13-6	But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.	2-Corinthians 13 : 6	Flowers_0001_218	bgc-0010
2-Corinthians-13-7	Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.	2-Corinthians 13 : 7	Flowers_0001_219	bgc-0011
2-Corinthians-13-8	For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.	2-Corinthians 13 : 8	Flowers_0001_220	bgc-0012
2-Corinthians-13-9	For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, <i>even</i> your perfection.	2-Corinthians 13 : 9	Flowers_0001_221	bgc-0013
2-Corinthians-13-10	Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.	2-Corinthians 13 : 10	Flowers_0001_222	bgc-0014
2-Corinthians-13-11	Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.	2-Corinthians 13 : 11	Flowers_0001_223	bgc-0015
2-Corinthians-13-12	Greet one another with an holy kiss.	2-Corinthians 13 : 12	Flowers_0001_224	bgc-0016
2-Corinthians-13-13	All the saints salute you.	2-Corinthians 13 : 13	Flowers_0001_225	bgc-0003
2-Corinthians-13-14	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, <i>be</i> with you all. Amen. 	2-Corinthians 13 : 14	Flowers_0001_226	bgc-0004
Galatians-1-1	Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)	Galatians 1 : 1	Flowers_0001_227	bgc-0005
Galatians-1-2	And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:	Galatians 1 : 2	Flowers_0001_228	bgc-0006
Galatians-1-3	Grace <i>be</i> to you and peace from God the Father, and <i>from</i> our Lord Jesus Christ,	Galatians 1 : 3	Flowers_0001_229	bgc-0007
Galatians-1-4	Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:	Galatians 1 : 4	Flowers_0001_230	bgc-0008
Galatians-1-5	To whom <i>be</i> glory for ever and ever. Amen.	Galatians 1 : 5	Flowers_0001_231	bgc-0009
Galatians-1-6	I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:	Galatians 1 : 6	Flowers_0001_232	bgc-0010
Galatians-1-7	Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.	Galatians 1 : 7	Flowers_0001_233	bgc-0011
Galatians-1-8	But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.	Galatians 1 : 8	Flowers_0001_234	bgc-0012
Galatians-1-9	As we said before, so say I now again, If any <i>man</i> preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.	Galatians 1 : 9	Flowers_0001_235	bgc-0013
Galatians-1-10	For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.	Galatians 1 : 10	Flowers_0001_236	bgc-0014
Galatians-1-11	But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.	Galatians 1 : 11	Flowers_0001_237	bgc-0015
Galatians-1-12	For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught <i>it</i>, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.	Galatians 1 : 12	Flowers_0001_238	bgc-0016
Galatians-1-13	For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jewsâ€™ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:	Galatians 1 : 13	Flowers_0001_239	bgc-0003
Galatians-1-14	And profited in the Jewsâ€™ religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.	Galatians 1 : 14	Flowers_0001_240	bgc-0004
Galatians-1-15	But when it pleased God, who separated me from my motherâ€™s womb, and called <i>me</i> by his grace,	Galatians 1 : 15	Flowers_0001_241	bgc-0005
Galatians-1-16	To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:	Galatians 1 : 16	Flowers_0001_242	bgc-0006
Galatians-1-17	Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.	Galatians 1 : 17	Flowers_0001_243	bgc-0007
Galatians-1-18	Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.	Galatians 1 : 18	Flowers_0001_244	bgc-0008
Galatians-1-19	But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lordâ€™s brother.	Galatians 1 : 19	Flowers_0001_245	bgc-0009
Galatians-1-20	Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.	Galatians 1 : 20	Flowers_0001_246	bgc-0010
Galatians-1-21	Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;	Galatians 1 : 21	Flowers_0001_247	bgc-0011
Galatians-1-22	And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:	Galatians 1 : 22	Flowers_0001_248	bgc-0012
Galatians-1-23	But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.	Galatians 1 : 23	Flowers_0001_249	bgc-0013
Galatians-1-24	And they glorified God in me.	Galatians 1 : 24	Flowers_0001_250	bgc-0014
Galatians-2-1	Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with <i>me</i> also.	Galatians 2 : 1	Flowers_0001_251	bgc-0015
Galatians-2-2	And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.	Galatians 2 : 2	Flowers_0001_252	bgc-0016
Galatians-2-3	But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:	Galatians 2 : 3	Flowers_0001_253	bgc-0003
Galatians-2-4	And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:	Galatians 2 : 4	Flowers_0001_254	bgc-0004
Galatians-2-5	To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.	Galatians 2 : 5	Flowers_0001_255	bgc-0005
Galatians-2-6	But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no manâ€™s person:) for they who seemed <i>to be somewhat</i> in conference added nothing to me:	Galatians 2 : 6	Flowers_0001_256	bgc-0006
Galatians-2-7	But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as <i>the gospel</i> of the circumcision <i>was</i> unto Peter;	Galatians 2 : 7	Flowers_0001_257	bgc-0007
Galatians-2-8	(For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)	Galatians 2 : 8	Flowers_0001_258	bgc-0008
Galatians-2-9	And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we <i>should go</i> unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.	Galatians 2 : 9	Flowers_0001_259	bgc-0009
Galatians-2-10	Only <i>they would</i> that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.	Galatians 2 : 10	Flowers_0001_260	bgc-0010
Galatians-2-11	But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.	Galatians 2 : 11	Flowers_0001_261	bgc-0011
Galatians-2-12	For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.	Galatians 2 : 12	Flowers_0001_262	bgc-0012
Galatians-2-13	And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.	Galatians 2 : 13	Flowers_0001_263	bgc-0013
Galatians-2-14	But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before <i>them</i> all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?	Galatians 2 : 14	Flowers_0001_264	bgc-0014
Galatians-2-15	We <i>who are</i> Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,	Galatians 2 : 15	Flowers_0001_265	bgc-0015
Galatians-2-16	Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.	Galatians 2 : 16	Flowers_0001_266	bgc-0016
Galatians-2-17	But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, <i>is</i> therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.	Galatians 2 : 17	Flowers_0001_267	bgc-0003
Galatians-2-18	For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.	Galatians 2 : 18	Flowers_0001_268	bgc-0004
Galatians-2-19	For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.	Galatians 2 : 19	Flowers_0001_269	bgc-0005
Galatians-2-20	I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.	Galatians 2 : 20	Flowers_0001_270	bgc-0006
Galatians-2-21	I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness <i>come</i> by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.	Galatians 2 : 21	Flowers_0001_271	bgc-0007
Galatians-3-1	O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?	Galatians 3 : 1	Flowers_0001_272	bgc-0008
Galatians-3-2	This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?	Galatians 3 : 2	Flowers_0001_273	bgc-0009
Galatians-3-3	Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?	Galatians 3 : 3	Flowers_0001_274	bgc-0010
Galatians-3-4	Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if <i>it be</i> yet in vain.	Galatians 3 : 4	Flowers_0001_275	bgc-0011
Galatians-3-5	He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, <i>doeth he it</i> by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?	Galatians 3 : 5	Flowers_0001_276	bgc-0012
Galatians-3-6	Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.	Galatians 3 : 6	Flowers_0001_277	bgc-0013
Galatians-3-7	Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.	Galatians 3 : 7	Flowers_0001_278	bgc-0014
Galatians-3-8	And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, <i>saying</i>, In thee shall all nations be blessed.	Galatians 3 : 8	Flowers_0001_279	bgc-0015
Galatians-3-9	So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.	Galatians 3 : 9	Flowers_0001_280	bgc-0016
Galatians-3-10	For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed <i>is</i> every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.	Galatians 3 : 10	Flowers_0001_281	bgc-0003
Galatians-3-11	But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, <i>it is</i> evident: for, The just shall live by faith.	Galatians 3 : 11	Flowers_0001_282	bgc-0004
Galatians-3-12	And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.	Galatians 3 : 12	Flowers_0001_283	bgc-0005
Galatians-3-13	Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed <i>is</i> every one that hangeth on a tree:	Galatians 3 : 13	Flowers_0001_284	bgc-0006
Galatians-3-14	That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.	Galatians 3 : 14	Flowers_0001_285	bgc-0007
Galatians-3-15	Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though <i>it be</i> but a manâ€™s covenant, yet <i>if it be</i> confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.	Galatians 3 : 15	Flowers_0001_286	bgc-0008
Galatians-3-16	Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.	Galatians 3 : 16	Flowers_0001_287	bgc-0009
Galatians-3-17	And this I say, <i>that</i> the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.	Galatians 3 : 17	Flowers_0001_288	bgc-0010
Galatians-3-18	For if the inheritance <i>be</i> of the law, <i>it is</i> no more of promise: but God gave <i>it</i> to Abraham by promise.	Galatians 3 : 18	Flowers_0001_289	bgc-0011
Galatians-3-19	Wherefore then <i>serveth</i> the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; <i>and it was</i> ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.	Galatians 3 : 19	Flowers_0001_290	bgc-0012
Galatians-3-20	Now a mediator is not <i>a mediator</i> of one, but God is one.	Galatians 3 : 20	Flowers_0001_291	bgc-0013
Galatians-3-21	<i>Is</i> the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.	Galatians 3 : 21	Flowers_0001_292	bgc-0014
Galatians-3-22	But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.	Galatians 3 : 22	Flowers_0001_293	bgc-0015
Galatians-3-23	But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.	Galatians 3 : 23	Flowers_0001_294	bgc-0016
Galatians-3-24	Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster <i>to bring us</i> unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.	Galatians 3 : 24	Flowers_0001_295	bgc-0003
Galatians-3-25	But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.	Galatians 3 : 25	Flowers_0001_296	bgc-0004
Galatians-3-26	For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.	Galatians 3 : 26	Flowers_0001_297	bgc-0005
Galatians-3-27	For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.	Galatians 3 : 27	Flowers_0001_298	bgc-0006
Galatians-3-28	There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.	Galatians 3 : 28	Flowers_0001_299	bgc-0007
Galatians-3-29	And if ye <i>be</i> Christâ€™s, then are ye Abrahamâ€™s seed, and heirs according to the promise.	Galatians 3 : 29	Flowers_0001_300	bgc-0008
Galatians-4-1	Now I say, <i>That</i> the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;	Galatians 4 : 1	Flowers_0001_301	bgc-0009
Galatians-4-2	But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.	Galatians 4 : 2	Flowers_0001_302	bgc-0010
Galatians-4-3	Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:	Galatians 4 : 3	Flowers_0001_303	bgc-0011
Galatians-4-4	But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,	Galatians 4 : 4	Flowers_0001_304	bgc-0012
Galatians-4-5	To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.	Galatians 4 : 5	Flowers_0001_305	bgc-0013
Galatians-4-6	And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.	Galatians 4 : 6	Flowers_0001_306	bgc-0014
Galatians-4-7	Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.	Galatians 4 : 7	Flowers_0001_307	bgc-0015
Galatians-4-8	Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.	Galatians 4 : 8	Flowers_0001_308	bgc-0016
Galatians-4-9	But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?	Galatians 4 : 9	Flowers_0001_309	bgc-0003
Galatians-4-10	Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.	Galatians 4 : 10	Flowers_0001_310	bgc-0004
Galatians-4-11	I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.	Galatians 4 : 11	Flowers_0001_311	bgc-0005
Galatians-4-12	Brethren, I beseech you, be as I <i>am</i>; for I <i>am</i> as ye <i>are</i>: ye have not injured me at all.	Galatians 4 : 12	Flowers_0001_312	bgc-0006
Galatians-4-13	Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.	Galatians 4 : 13	Flowers_0001_313	bgc-0007
Galatians-4-14	And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, <i>even</i> as Christ Jesus.	Galatians 4 : 14	Flowers_0001_314	bgc-0008
Galatians-4-15	Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if <i>it had been</i> possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.	Galatians 4 : 15	Flowers_0001_315	bgc-0009
Galatians-4-16	Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?	Galatians 4 : 16	Flowers_0001_316	bgc-0010
Galatians-4-17	They zealously affect you, <i>but</i> not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.	Galatians 4 : 17	Flowers_0001_317	bgc-0011
Galatians-4-18	But <i>it is</i> good to be zealously affected always in <i>a</i> good <i>thing</i>, and not only when I am present with you.	Galatians 4 : 18	Flowers_0001_318	bgc-0012
Galatians-4-19	My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,	Galatians 4 : 19	Flowers_0001_319	bgc-0013
Galatians-4-20	I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.	Galatians 4 : 20	Flowers_0001_320	bgc-0014
Galatians-4-21	Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?	Galatians 4 : 21	Flowers_0001_321	bgc-0015
Galatians-4-22	For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.	Galatians 4 : 22	Flowers_0001_322	bgc-0016
Galatians-4-23	But he <i>who was</i> of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman <i>was</i> by promise.	Galatians 4 : 23	Flowers_0001_323	bgc-0003
Galatians-4-24	Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.	Galatians 4 : 24	Flowers_0001_324	bgc-0004
Galatians-4-25	For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.	Galatians 4 : 25	Flowers_0001_325	bgc-0005
Galatians-4-26	But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.	Galatians 4 : 26	Flowers_0001_326	bgc-0006
Galatians-4-27	For it is written, Rejoice, <i>thou</i> barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.	Galatians 4 : 27	Flowers_0001_327	bgc-0007
Galatians-4-28	Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.	Galatians 4 : 28	Flowers_0001_328	bgc-0008
Galatians-4-29	But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him <i>that was born</i> after the Spirit, even so <i>it is</i> now.	Galatians 4 : 29	Flowers_0001_329	bgc-0009
Galatians-4-30	Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.	Galatians 4 : 30	Flowers_0001_330	bgc-0010
Galatians-4-31	So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.	Galatians 4 : 31	Flowers_0001_331	bgc-0011
Galatians-5-1	Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.	Galatians 5 : 1	Flowers_0001_332	bgc-0012
Galatians-5-2	Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.	Galatians 5 : 2	Flowers_0001_333	bgc-0013
Galatians-5-3	For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.	Galatians 5 : 3	Flowers_0001_334	bgc-0014
Galatians-5-4	Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.	Galatians 5 : 4	Flowers_0001_335	bgc-0015
Galatians-5-5	For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.	Galatians 5 : 5	Flowers_0001_336	bgc-0016
Galatians-5-6	For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.	Galatians 5 : 6	Flowers_0001_337	bgc-0003
Galatians-5-7	Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?	Galatians 5 : 7	Flowers_0001_338	bgc-0004
Galatians-5-8	This persuasion <i>cometh</i> not of him that calleth you.	Galatians 5 : 8	Flowers_0001_339	bgc-0005
Galatians-5-9	A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.	Galatians 5 : 9	Flowers_0001_340	bgc-0006
Galatians-5-10	I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.	Galatians 5 : 10	Flowers_0001_341	bgc-0007
Galatians-5-11	And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.	Galatians 5 : 11	Flowers_0001_342	bgc-0008
Galatians-5-12	I would they were even cut off which trouble you.	Galatians 5 : 12	Flowers_0001_343	bgc-0009
Galatians-5-13	For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only <i>use</i> not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.	Galatians 5 : 13	Flowers_0001_1	bgc-0010
Galatians-5-14	For all the law is fulfilled in one word, <i>even</i> in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.	Galatians 5 : 14	Flowers_0001_2	bgc-0011
Galatians-5-15	But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.	Galatians 5 : 15	Flowers_0001_3	bgc-0012
Galatians-5-16	<i>This</i> I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.	Galatians 5 : 16	Flowers_0001_4	bgc-0013
Galatians-5-17	For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.	Galatians 5 : 17	Flowers_0001_5	bgc-0014
Galatians-5-18	But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.	Galatians 5 : 18	Flowers_0001_6	bgc-0015
Galatians-5-19	Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are <i>these</i>; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,	Galatians 5 : 19	Flowers_0001_7	bgc-0016
Galatians-5-20	Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,	Galatians 5 : 20	Flowers_0001_8	bgc-0003
Galatians-5-21	Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told <i>you</i> in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.	Galatians 5 : 21	Flowers_0001_9	bgc-0004
Galatians-5-22	But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,	Galatians 5 : 22	Flowers_0001_10	bgc-0005
Galatians-5-23	Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.	Galatians 5 : 23	Flowers_0001_11	bgc-0006
Galatians-5-24	And they that are Christâ€™s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.	Galatians 5 : 24	Flowers_0001_12	bgc-0007
Galatians-5-25	If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.	Galatians 5 : 25	Flowers_0001_13	bgc-0008
Galatians-5-26	Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.	Galatians 5 : 26	Flowers_0001_14	bgc-0009
Galatians-6-1	Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.	Galatians 6 : 1	Flowers_0001_15	bgc-0010
Galatians-6-2	Bear ye one anotherâ€™s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.	Galatians 6 : 2	Flowers_0001_16	bgc-0011
Galatians-6-3	For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.	Galatians 6 : 3	Flowers_0001_17	bgc-0012
Galatians-6-4	But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.	Galatians 6 : 4	Flowers_0001_18	bgc-0013
Galatians-6-5	For every man shall bear his own burden.	Galatians 6 : 5	Flowers_0001_19	bgc-0014
Galatians-6-6	Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.	Galatians 6 : 6	Flowers_0001_20	bgc-0015
Galatians-6-7	Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.	Galatians 6 : 7	Flowers_0001_21	bgc-0016
Galatians-6-8	For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.	Galatians 6 : 8	Flowers_0001_22	bgc-0003
Galatians-6-9	And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.	Galatians 6 : 9	Flowers_0001_23	bgc-0004
Galatians-6-10	As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all <i>men</i>, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.	Galatians 6 : 10	Flowers_0001_24	bgc-0005
Galatians-6-11	Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.	Galatians 6 : 11	Flowers_0001_25	bgc-0006
Galatians-6-12	As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.	Galatians 6 : 12	Flowers_0001_26	bgc-0007
Galatians-6-13	For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.	Galatians 6 : 13	Flowers_0001_27	bgc-0008
Galatians-6-14	But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.	Galatians 6 : 14	Flowers_0001_28	bgc-0009
Galatians-6-15	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.	Galatians 6 : 15	Flowers_0001_29	bgc-0010
Galatians-6-16	And as many as walk according to this rule, peace <i>be</i> on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.	Galatians 6 : 16	Flowers_0001_30	bgc-0011
Galatians-6-17	From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.	Galatians 6 : 17	Flowers_0001_31	bgc-0012
Galatians-6-18	Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with your spirit. Amen. 	Galatians 6 : 18	Flowers_0001_32	bgc-0013
Ephesians-1-1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:	Ephesians 1 : 1	Flowers_0001_33	bgc-0014
Ephesians-1-2	Grace <i>be</i> to you, and peace, from God our Father, and <i>from</i> the Lord Jesus Christ.	Ephesians 1 : 2	Flowers_0001_34	bgc-0015
Ephesians-1-3	Blessed <i>be</i> the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly <i>places</i> in Christ:	Ephesians 1 : 3	Flowers_0001_35	bgc-0016
Ephesians-1-4	According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:	Ephesians 1 : 4	Flowers_0001_36	bgc-0003
Ephesians-1-5	Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,	Ephesians 1 : 5	Flowers_0001_37	bgc-0004
Ephesians-1-6	To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.	Ephesians 1 : 6	Flowers_0001_38	bgc-0005
Ephesians-1-7	In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;	Ephesians 1 : 7	Flowers_0001_39	bgc-0006
Ephesians-1-8	Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;	Ephesians 1 : 8	Flowers_0001_40	bgc-0007
Ephesians-1-9	Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:	Ephesians 1 : 9	Flowers_0001_41	bgc-0008
Ephesians-1-10	That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; <i>even</i> in him:	Ephesians 1 : 10	Flowers_0001_42	bgc-0009
Ephesians-1-11	In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:	Ephesians 1 : 11	Flowers_0001_43	bgc-0010
Ephesians-1-12	That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.	Ephesians 1 : 12	Flowers_0001_44	bgc-0011
Ephesians-1-13	In whom ye also <i>trusted</i>, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,	Ephesians 1 : 13	Flowers_0001_45	bgc-0012
Ephesians-1-14	Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.	Ephesians 1 : 14	Flowers_0001_46	bgc-0013
Ephesians-1-15	Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,	Ephesians 1 : 15	Flowers_0001_47	bgc-0014
Ephesians-1-16	Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;	Ephesians 1 : 16	Flowers_0001_48	bgc-0015
Ephesians-1-17	That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:	Ephesians 1 : 17	Flowers_0001_49	bgc-0016
Ephesians-1-18	The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,	Ephesians 1 : 18	Flowers_0001_50	bgc-0003
Ephesians-1-19	And what <i>is</i> the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,	Ephesians 1 : 19	Flowers_0001_51	bgc-0004
Ephesians-1-20	Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set <i>him</i> at his own right hand in the heavenly <i>places</i>,	Ephesians 1 : 20	Flowers_0001_52	bgc-0005
Ephesians-1-21	Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:	Ephesians 1 : 21	Flowers_0001_53	bgc-0006
Ephesians-1-22	And hath put all <i>things</i> under his feet, and gave him <i>to be</i> the head over all <i>things</i> to the church,	Ephesians 1 : 22	Flowers_0001_54	bgc-0007
Ephesians-1-23	Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.	Ephesians 1 : 23	Flowers_0001_55	bgc-0008
Ephesians-2-1	And you <i>hath he quickened</i>, who were dead in trespasses and sins;	Ephesians 2 : 1	Flowers_0001_56	bgc-0009
Ephesians-2-2	Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:	Ephesians 2 : 2	Flowers_0001_57	bgc-0010
Ephesians-2-3	Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.	Ephesians 2 : 3	Flowers_0001_58	bgc-0011
Ephesians-2-4	But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,	Ephesians 2 : 4	Flowers_0001_59	bgc-0012
Ephesians-2-5	Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)	Ephesians 2 : 5	Flowers_0001_60	bgc-0013
Ephesians-2-6	And hath raised <i>us</i> up together, and made <i>us</i> sit together in heavenly <i>places</i> in Christ Jesus:	Ephesians 2 : 6	Flowers_0001_61	bgc-0014
Ephesians-2-7	That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in <i>his</i> kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.	Ephesians 2 : 7	Flowers_0001_62	bgc-0015
Ephesians-2-8	For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: <i>it is</i> the gift of God:	Ephesians 2 : 8	Flowers_0001_63	bgc-0016
Ephesians-2-9	Not of works, lest any man should boast.	Ephesians 2 : 9	Flowers_0001_64	bgc-0003
Ephesians-2-10	For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.	Ephesians 2 : 10	Flowers_0001_65	bgc-0004
Ephesians-2-11	Wherefore remember, that ye <i>being</i> in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;	Ephesians 2 : 11	Flowers_0001_66	bgc-0005
Ephesians-2-12	That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:	Ephesians 2 : 12	Flowers_0001_67	bgc-0006
Ephesians-2-13	But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.	Ephesians 2 : 13	Flowers_0001_68	bgc-0007
Ephesians-2-14	For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition <i>between us</i>;	Ephesians 2 : 14	Flowers_0001_69	bgc-0008
Ephesians-2-15	Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, <i>even</i> the law of commandments <i>contained</i> in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, <i>so</i> making peace;	Ephesians 2 : 15	Flowers_0001_70	bgc-0009
Ephesians-2-16	And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:	Ephesians 2 : 16	Flowers_0001_71	bgc-0010
Ephesians-2-17	And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.	Ephesians 2 : 17	Flowers_0001_72	bgc-0011
Ephesians-2-18	For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.	Ephesians 2 : 18	Flowers_0001_73	bgc-0012
Ephesians-2-19	Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;	Ephesians 2 : 19	Flowers_0001_74	bgc-0013
Ephesians-2-20	And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner <i>stone</i>;	Ephesians 2 : 20	Flowers_0001_75	bgc-0014
Ephesians-2-21	In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:	Ephesians 2 : 21	Flowers_0001_76	bgc-0015
Ephesians-2-22	In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.	Ephesians 2 : 22	Flowers_0001_77	bgc-0016
Ephesians-3-1	For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,	Ephesians 3 : 1	Flowers_0001_78	bgc-0003
Ephesians-3-2	If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:	Ephesians 3 : 2	Flowers_0001_79	bgc-0004
Ephesians-3-3	How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; as I wrote afore in few words,	Ephesians 3 : 3	Flowers_0001_80	bgc-0005
Ephesians-3-4	Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ	Ephesians 3 : 4	Flowers_0001_81	bgc-0006
Ephesians-3-5	Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;	Ephesians 3 : 5	Flowers_0001_82	bgc-0007
Ephesians-3-6	That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:	Ephesians 3 : 6	Flowers_0001_83	bgc-0008
Ephesians-3-7	Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.	Ephesians 3 : 7	Flowers_0001_84	bgc-0009
Ephesians-3-8	Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;	Ephesians 3 : 8	Flowers_0001_85	bgc-0010
Ephesians-3-9	And to make all <i>men</i> see what <i>is</i> the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:	Ephesians 3 : 9	Flowers_0001_86	bgc-0011
Ephesians-3-10	To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly <i>places</i> might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,	Ephesians 3 : 10	Flowers_0001_87	bgc-0012
Ephesians-3-11	According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:	Ephesians 3 : 11	Flowers_0001_88	bgc-0013
Ephesians-3-12	In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.	Ephesians 3 : 12	Flowers_0001_89	bgc-0014
Ephesians-3-13	Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.	Ephesians 3 : 13	Flowers_0001_90	bgc-0015
Ephesians-3-14	For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,	Ephesians 3 : 14	Flowers_0001_91	bgc-0016
Ephesians-3-15	Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,	Ephesians 3 : 15	Flowers_0001_92	bgc-0003
Ephesians-3-16	That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;	Ephesians 3 : 16	Flowers_0001_93	bgc-0004
Ephesians-3-17	That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,	Ephesians 3 : 17	Flowers_0001_94	bgc-0005
Ephesians-3-18	May be able to comprehend with all saints what <i>is</i> the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;	Ephesians 3 : 18	Flowers_0001_95	bgc-0006
Ephesians-3-19	And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.	Ephesians 3 : 19	Flowers_0001_96	bgc-0007
Ephesians-3-20	Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,	Ephesians 3 : 20	Flowers_0001_97	bgc-0008
Ephesians-3-21	Unto him <i>be</i> glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.	Ephesians 3 : 21	Flowers_0001_98	bgc-0009
Ephesians-4-1	I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,	Ephesians 4 : 1	Flowers_0001_99	bgc-0010
Ephesians-4-2	With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;	Ephesians 4 : 2	Flowers_0001_100	bgc-0011
Ephesians-4-3	Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.	Ephesians 4 : 3	Flowers_0001_101	bgc-0012
Ephesians-4-4	<i>There is</i> one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;	Ephesians 4 : 4	Flowers_0001_102	bgc-0013
Ephesians-4-5	One Lord, one faith, one baptism,	Ephesians 4 : 5	Flowers_0001_103	bgc-0014
Ephesians-4-6	One God and Father of all, who <i>is</i> above all, and through all, and in you all.	Ephesians 4 : 6	Flowers_0001_104	bgc-0015
Ephesians-4-7	But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.	Ephesians 4 : 7	Flowers_0001_105	bgc-0016
Ephesians-4-8	Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.	Ephesians 4 : 8	Flowers_0001_106	bgc-0003
Ephesians-4-9	Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?	Ephesians 4 : 9	Flowers_0001_107	bgc-0004
Ephesians-4-10	He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.	Ephesians 4 : 10	Flowers_0001_108	bgc-0005
Ephesians-4-11	And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;	Ephesians 4 : 11	Flowers_0001_109	bgc-0006
Ephesians-4-12	For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:	Ephesians 4 : 12	Flowers_0001_110	bgc-0007
Ephesians-4-13	Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:	Ephesians 4 : 13	Flowers_0001_111	bgc-0008
Ephesians-4-14	That we <i>henceforth</i> be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, <i>and</i> cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;	Ephesians 4 : 14	Flowers_0001_112	bgc-0009
Ephesians-4-15	But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, <i>even</i> Christ:	Ephesians 4 : 15	Flowers_0001_113	bgc-0010
Ephesians-4-16	From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love.	Ephesians 4 : 16	Flowers_0001_114	bgc-0011
Ephesians-4-17	This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,	Ephesians 4 : 17	Flowers_0001_115	bgc-0012
Ephesians-4-18	Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:	Ephesians 4 : 18	Flowers_0001_116	bgc-0013
Ephesians-4-19	Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.	Ephesians 4 : 19	Flowers_0001_117	bgc-0014
Ephesians-4-20	But ye have not so learned Christ;	Ephesians 4 : 20	Flowers_0001_118	bgc-0015
Ephesians-4-21	If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:	Ephesians 4 : 21	Flowers_0001_119	bgc-0016
Ephesians-4-22	That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;	Ephesians 4 : 22	Flowers_0001_120	bgc-0003
Ephesians-4-23	And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;	Ephesians 4 : 23	Flowers_0001_121	bgc-0004
Ephesians-4-24	And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.	Ephesians 4 : 24	Flowers_0001_122	bgc-0005
Ephesians-4-25	Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.	Ephesians 4 : 25	Flowers_0001_123	bgc-0006
Ephesians-4-26	Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:	Ephesians 4 : 26	Flowers_0001_124	bgc-0007
Ephesians-4-27	Neither give place to the devil.	Ephesians 4 : 27	Flowers_0001_125	bgc-0008
Ephesians-4-28	Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with <i>his</i> hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth.	Ephesians 4 : 28	Flowers_0001_126	bgc-0009
Ephesians-4-29	Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.	Ephesians 4 : 29	Flowers_0001_127	bgc-0010
Ephesians-4-30	And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.	Ephesians 4 : 30	Flowers_0001_128	bgc-0011
Ephesians-4-31	Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:	Ephesians 4 : 31	Flowers_0001_129	bgc-0012
Ephesians-4-32	And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christâ€™s sake hath forgiven you.	Ephesians 4 : 32	Flowers_0001_130	bgc-0013
Ephesians-5-1	Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;	Ephesians 5 : 1	Flowers_0001_131	bgc-0014
Ephesians-5-2	And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.	Ephesians 5 : 2	Flowers_0001_132	bgc-0015
Ephesians-5-3	But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;	Ephesians 5 : 3	Flowers_0001_133	bgc-0016
Ephesians-5-4	Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.	Ephesians 5 : 4	Flowers_0001_134	bgc-0003
Ephesians-5-5	For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.	Ephesians 5 : 5	Flowers_0001_135	bgc-0004
Ephesians-5-6	Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.	Ephesians 5 : 6	Flowers_0001_136	bgc-0005
Ephesians-5-7	Be not ye therefore partakers with them.	Ephesians 5 : 7	Flowers_0001_137	bgc-0006
Ephesians-5-8	For ye were sometimes darkness, but now <i>are ye</i> light in the Lord: walk as children of light:	Ephesians 5 : 8	Flowers_0001_138	bgc-0007
Ephesians-5-9	(For the fruit of the Spirit <i>is</i> in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)	Ephesians 5 : 9	Flowers_0001_139	bgc-0008
Ephesians-5-10	Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.	Ephesians 5 : 10	Flowers_0001_140	bgc-0009
Ephesians-5-11	And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove <i>them</i>.	Ephesians 5 : 11	Flowers_0001_141	bgc-0010
Ephesians-5-12	For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.	Ephesians 5 : 12	Flowers_0001_142	bgc-0011
Ephesians-5-13	But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.	Ephesians 5 : 13	Flowers_0001_143	bgc-0012
Ephesians-5-14	Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.	Ephesians 5 : 14	Flowers_0001_144	bgc-0013
Ephesians-5-15	See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,	Ephesians 5 : 15	Flowers_0001_145	bgc-0014
Ephesians-5-16	Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.	Ephesians 5 : 16	Flowers_0001_146	bgc-0015
Ephesians-5-17	Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord <i>is</i>.	Ephesians 5 : 17	Flowers_0001_147	bgc-0016
Ephesians-5-18	And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;	Ephesians 5 : 18	Flowers_0001_148	bgc-0003
Ephesians-5-19	Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;	Ephesians 5 : 19	Flowers_0001_149	bgc-0004
Ephesians-5-20	Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;	Ephesians 5 : 20	Flowers_0001_150	bgc-0005
Ephesians-5-21	Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.	Ephesians 5 : 21	Flowers_0001_151	bgc-0006
Ephesians-5-22	Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.	Ephesians 5 : 22	Flowers_0001_152	bgc-0007
Ephesians-5-23	For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.	Ephesians 5 : 23	Flowers_0001_153	bgc-0008
Ephesians-5-24	Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so <i>let</i> the wives <i>be</i> to their own husbands in every thing.	Ephesians 5 : 24	Flowers_0001_154	bgc-0009
Ephesians-5-25	Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;	Ephesians 5 : 25	Flowers_0001_155	bgc-0010
Ephesians-5-26	That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,	Ephesians 5 : 26	Flowers_0001_156	bgc-0011
Ephesians-5-27	That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.	Ephesians 5 : 27	Flowers_0001_157	bgc-0012
Ephesians-5-28	So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.	Ephesians 5 : 28	Flowers_0001_158	bgc-0013
Ephesians-5-29	For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:	Ephesians 5 : 29	Flowers_0001_159	bgc-0014
Ephesians-5-30	For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.	Ephesians 5 : 30	Flowers_0001_160	bgc-0015
Ephesians-5-31	For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.	Ephesians 5 : 31	Flowers_0001_161	bgc-0016
Ephesians-5-32	This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.	Ephesians 5 : 32	Flowers_0001_162	bgc-0003
Ephesians-5-33	Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife <i>see</i> that she reverence <i>her</i> husband.	Ephesians 5 : 33	Flowers_0001_163	bgc-0004
Ephesians-6-1	Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.	Ephesians 6 : 1	Flowers_0001_164	bgc-0005
Ephesians-6-2	Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)	Ephesians 6 : 2	Flowers_0001_165	bgc-0006
Ephesians-6-3	That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.	Ephesians 6 : 3	Flowers_0001_166	bgc-0007
Ephesians-6-4	And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.	Ephesians 6 : 4	Flowers_0001_167	bgc-0008
Ephesians-6-5	Servants, be obedient to them that are <i>your</i> masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;	Ephesians 6 : 5	Flowers_0001_168	bgc-0009
Ephesians-6-6	Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;	Ephesians 6 : 6	Flowers_0001_169	bgc-0010
Ephesians-6-7	With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:	Ephesians 6 : 7	Flowers_0001_170	bgc-0011
Ephesians-6-8	Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether <i>he be</i> bond or free.	Ephesians 6 : 8	Flowers_0001_171	bgc-0012
Ephesians-6-9	And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.	Ephesians 6 : 9	Flowers_0001_172	bgc-0013
Ephesians-6-10	Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.	Ephesians 6 : 10	Flowers_0001_173	bgc-0014
Ephesians-6-11	Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.	Ephesians 6 : 11	Flowers_0001_174	bgc-0015
Ephesians-6-12	For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high <i>places</i>.	Ephesians 6 : 12	Flowers_0001_175	bgc-0016
Ephesians-6-13	Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.	Ephesians 6 : 13	Flowers_0001_176	bgc-0003
Ephesians-6-14	Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;	Ephesians 6 : 14	Flowers_0001_177	bgc-0004
Ephesians-6-15	And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;	Ephesians 6 : 15	Flowers_0001_178	bgc-0005
Ephesians-6-16	Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.	Ephesians 6 : 16	Flowers_0001_179	bgc-0006
Ephesians-6-17	And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:	Ephesians 6 : 17	Flowers_0001_180	bgc-0007
Ephesians-6-18	Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;	Ephesians 6 : 18	Flowers_0001_181	bgc-0008
Ephesians-6-19	And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,	Ephesians 6 : 19	Flowers_0001_182	bgc-0009
Ephesians-6-20	For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.	Ephesians 6 : 20	Flowers_0001_183	bgc-0010
Ephesians-6-21	But that ye also may know my affairs, <i>and</i> how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:	Ephesians 6 : 21	Flowers_0001_184	bgc-0011
Ephesians-6-22	Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and <i>that</i> he might comfort your hearts.	Ephesians 6 : 22	Flowers_0001_185	bgc-0012
Ephesians-6-23	Peace <i>be</i> to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	Ephesians 6 : 23	Flowers_0001_186	bgc-0013
Ephesians-6-24	Grace <i>be</i> with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen. 	Ephesians 6 : 24	Flowers_0001_187	bgc-0014
Philippians-1-1	Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:	Philippians 1 : 1	Flowers_0001_188	bgc-0015
Philippians-1-2	Grace <i>be</i> unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and <i>from</i> the Lord Jesus Christ.	Philippians 1 : 2	Flowers_0001_189	bgc-0016
Philippians-1-3	I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,	Philippians 1 : 3	Flowers_0001_190	bgc-0003
Philippians-1-4	Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,	Philippians 1 : 4	Flowers_0001_191	bgc-0004
Philippians-1-5	For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;	Philippians 1 : 5	Flowers_0001_192	bgc-0005
Philippians-1-6	Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform <i>it</i> until the day of Jesus Christ:	Philippians 1 : 6	Flowers_0001_193	bgc-0006
Philippians-1-7	Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.	Philippians 1 : 7	Flowers_0001_194	bgc-0007
Philippians-1-8	For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.	Philippians 1 : 8	Flowers_0001_195	bgc-0008
Philippians-1-9	And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and <i>in</i> all judgment;	Philippians 1 : 9	Flowers_0001_196	bgc-0009
Philippians-1-10	That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ;	Philippians 1 : 10	Flowers_0001_197	bgc-0010
Philippians-1-11	Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.	Philippians 1 : 11	Flowers_0001_198	bgc-0011
Philippians-1-12	But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things <i>which happened</i> unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;	Philippians 1 : 12	Flowers_0001_199	bgc-0012
Philippians-1-13	So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other <i>places</i>;	Philippians 1 : 13	Flowers_0001_200	bgc-0013
Philippians-1-14	And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.	Philippians 1 : 14	Flowers_0001_201	bgc-0014
Philippians-1-15	Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:	Philippians 1 : 15	Flowers_0001_202	bgc-0015
Philippians-1-16	The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:	Philippians 1 : 16	Flowers_0001_203	bgc-0016
Philippians-1-17	But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.	Philippians 1 : 17	Flowers_0001_204	bgc-0003
Philippians-1-18	What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.	Philippians 1 : 18	Flowers_0001_205	bgc-0004
Philippians-1-19	For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,	Philippians 1 : 19	Flowers_0001_206	bgc-0005
Philippians-1-20	According to my earnest expectation and <i>my</i> hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but <i>that</i> with all boldness, as always, <i>so</i> now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether <i>it be</i> by life, or by death.	Philippians 1 : 20	Flowers_0001_207	bgc-0006
Philippians-1-21	For to me to live <i>is</i> Christ, and to die <i>is</i> gain.	Philippians 1 : 21	Flowers_0001_208	bgc-0007
Philippians-1-22	But if I live in the flesh, this <i>is</i> the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.	Philippians 1 : 22	Flowers_0001_209	bgc-0008
Philippians-1-23	For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:	Philippians 1 : 23	Flowers_0001_210	bgc-0009
Philippians-1-24	Nevertheless to abide in the flesh <i>is</i> more needful for you.	Philippians 1 : 24	Flowers_0001_211	bgc-0010
Philippians-1-25	And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;	Philippians 1 : 25	Flowers_0001_212	bgc-0011
Philippians-1-26	That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.	Philippians 1 : 26	Flowers_0001_213	bgc-0012
Philippians-1-27	Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;	Philippians 1 : 27	Flowers_0001_214	bgc-0013
Philippians-1-28	And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.	Philippians 1 : 28	Flowers_0001_215	bgc-0014
Philippians-1-29	For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;	Philippians 1 : 29	Flowers_0001_216	bgc-0015
Philippians-1-30	Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear <i>to be</i> in me.	Philippians 1 : 30	Flowers_0001_217	bgc-0016
Philippians-2-1	If <i>there be</i> therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,	Philippians 2 : 1	Flowers_0001_218	bgc-0003
Philippians-2-2	Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, <i>being</i> of one accord, of one mind.	Philippians 2 : 2	Flowers_0001_219	bgc-0004
Philippians-2-3	<i>Let</i> nothing <i>be done</i> through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.	Philippians 2 : 3	Flowers_0001_220	bgc-0005
Philippians-2-4	Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.	Philippians 2 : 4	Flowers_0001_221	bgc-0006
Philippians-2-5	Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:	Philippians 2 : 5	Flowers_0001_222	bgc-0007
Philippians-2-6	Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:	Philippians 2 : 6	Flowers_0001_223	bgc-0008
Philippians-2-7	But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:	Philippians 2 : 7	Flowers_0001_224	bgc-0009
Philippians-2-8	And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.	Philippians 2 : 8	Flowers_0001_225	bgc-0010
Philippians-2-9	Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:	Philippians 2 : 9	Flowers_0001_226	bgc-0011
Philippians-2-10	That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of <i>things</i> in heaven, and <i>things</i> in earth, and <i>things</i> under the earth;	Philippians 2 : 10	Flowers_0001_227	bgc-0012
Philippians-2-11	And <i>that</i> every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ <i>is</i> Lord, to the glory of God the Father.	Philippians 2 : 11	Flowers_0001_228	bgc-0013
Philippians-2-12	Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.	Philippians 2 : 12	Flowers_0001_229	bgc-0014
Philippians-2-13	For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of <i>his</i> good pleasure.	Philippians 2 : 13	Flowers_0001_230	bgc-0015
Philippians-2-14	Do all things without murmurings and disputings:	Philippians 2 : 14	Flowers_0001_231	bgc-0016
Philippians-2-15	That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;	Philippians 2 : 15	Flowers_0001_232	bgc-0003
Philippians-2-16	Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.	Philippians 2 : 16	Flowers_0001_233	bgc-0004
Philippians-2-17	Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.	Philippians 2 : 17	Flowers_0001_234	bgc-0005
Philippians-2-18	For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.	Philippians 2 : 18	Flowers_0001_235	bgc-0006
Philippians-2-19	But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.	Philippians 2 : 19	Flowers_0001_236	bgc-0007
Philippians-2-20	For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.	Philippians 2 : 20	Flowers_0001_237	bgc-0008
Philippians-2-21	For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christâ€™s.	Philippians 2 : 21	Flowers_0001_238	bgc-0009
Philippians-2-22	But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.	Philippians 2 : 22	Flowers_0001_239	bgc-0010
Philippians-2-23	Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.	Philippians 2 : 23	Flowers_0001_240	bgc-0011
Philippians-2-24	But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.	Philippians 2 : 24	Flowers_0001_241	bgc-0012
Philippians-2-25	Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.	Philippians 2 : 25	Flowers_0001_242	bgc-0013
Philippians-2-26	For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.	Philippians 2 : 26	Flowers_0001_243	bgc-0014
Philippians-2-27	For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.	Philippians 2 : 27	Flowers_0001_244	bgc-0015
Philippians-2-28	I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.	Philippians 2 : 28	Flowers_0001_245	bgc-0016
Philippians-2-29	Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:	Philippians 2 : 29	Flowers_0001_246	bgc-0003
Philippians-2-30	Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.	Philippians 2 : 30	Flowers_0001_247	bgc-0004
Philippians-3-1	Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed <i>is</i> not grievous, but for you <i>it is</i> safe.	Philippians 3 : 1	Flowers_0001_248	bgc-0005
Philippians-3-2	Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.	Philippians 3 : 2	Flowers_0001_249	bgc-0006
Philippians-3-3	For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.	Philippians 3 : 3	Flowers_0001_250	bgc-0007
Philippians-3-4	Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:	Philippians 3 : 4	Flowers_0001_251	bgc-0008
Philippians-3-5	Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, <i>of</i> the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;	Philippians 3 : 5	Flowers_0001_252	bgc-0009
Philippians-3-6	Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.	Philippians 3 : 6	Flowers_0001_253	bgc-0010
Philippians-3-7	But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.	Philippians 3 : 7	Flowers_0001_254	bgc-0011
Philippians-3-8	Yea doubtless, and I count all things <i>but</i> loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them <i>but</i> dung, that I may win Christ,	Philippians 3 : 8	Flowers_0001_255	bgc-0012
Philippians-3-9	And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:	Philippians 3 : 9	Flowers_0001_256	bgc-0013
Philippians-3-10	That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;	Philippians 3 : 10	Flowers_0001_257	bgc-0014
Philippians-3-11	If by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.	Philippians 3 : 11	Flowers_0001_258	bgc-0015
Philippians-3-12	Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus.	Philippians 3 : 12	Flowers_0001_259	bgc-0016
Philippians-3-13	Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended: but <i>this</i> one thing <i>I do</i>, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before,	Philippians 3 : 13	Flowers_0001_260	bgc-0003
Philippians-3-14	I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.	Philippians 3 : 14	Flowers_0001_261	bgc-0004
Philippians-3-15	Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.	Philippians 3 : 15	Flowers_0001_262	bgc-0005
Philippians-3-16	Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.	Philippians 3 : 16	Flowers_0001_263	bgc-0006
Philippians-3-17	Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample.	Philippians 3 : 17	Flowers_0001_264	bgc-0007
Philippians-3-18	For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, <i>that they are</i> the enemies of the cross of Christ:	Philippians 3 : 18	Flowers_0001_265	bgc-0008
Philippians-3-19	Whose end <i>is</i> destruction, whose God <i>is their</i> belly, and <i>whose</i> glory <i>is</i> in their shame, who mind earthly things.	Philippians 3 : 19	Flowers_0001_266	bgc-0009
Philippians-3-20	For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:	Philippians 3 : 20	Flowers_0001_267	bgc-0010
Philippians-3-21	Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself.	Philippians 3 : 21	Flowers_0001_268	bgc-0011
Philippians-4-1	Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, <i>my</i> dearly beloved.	Philippians 4 : 1	Flowers_0001_269	bgc-0012
Philippians-4-2	I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.	Philippians 4 : 2	Flowers_0001_270	bgc-0013
Philippians-4-3	And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and <i>with</i> other my fellowlabourers, whose names <i>are</i> in the book of life.	Philippians 4 : 3	Flowers_0001_271	bgc-0014
Philippians-4-4	Rejoice in the Lord alway: <i>and</i> again I say, Rejoice.	Philippians 4 : 4	Flowers_0001_272	bgc-0015
Philippians-4-5	Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord <i>is</i> at hand.	Philippians 4 : 5	Flowers_0001_273	bgc-0016
Philippians-4-6	Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.	Philippians 4 : 6	Flowers_0001_274	bgc-0003
Philippians-4-7	And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.	Philippians 4 : 7	Flowers_0001_275	bgc-0004
Philippians-4-8	Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things <i>are</i> honest, whatsoever things <i>are</i> just, whatsoever things <i>are</i> pure, whatsoever things <i>are</i> lovely, whatsoever things <i>are</i> of good report; if <i>there be</i> any virtue, and if <i>there be</i> any praise, think on these things.	Philippians 4 : 8	Flowers_0001_276	bgc-0005
Philippians-4-9	Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.	Philippians 4 : 9	Flowers_0001_277	bgc-0006
Philippians-4-10	But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.	Philippians 4 : 10	Flowers_0001_278	bgc-0007
Philippians-4-11	Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, <i>therewith</i> to be content.	Philippians 4 : 11	Flowers_0001_279	bgc-0008
Philippians-4-12	I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.	Philippians 4 : 12	Flowers_0001_280	bgc-0009
Philippians-4-13	I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.	Philippians 4 : 13	Flowers_0001_281	bgc-0010
Philippians-4-14	Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.	Philippians 4 : 14	Flowers_0001_282	bgc-0011
Philippians-4-15	Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.	Philippians 4 : 15	Flowers_0001_283	bgc-0012
Philippians-4-16	For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.	Philippians 4 : 16	Flowers_0001_284	bgc-0013
Philippians-4-17	Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.	Philippians 4 : 17	Flowers_0001_285	bgc-0014
Philippians-4-18	But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things <i>which were sent</i> from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.	Philippians 4 : 18	Flowers_0001_286	bgc-0015
Philippians-4-19	But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.	Philippians 4 : 19	Flowers_0001_287	bgc-0016
Philippians-4-20	Now unto God and our Father <i>be</i> glory for ever and ever. Amen.	Philippians 4 : 20	Flowers_0001_288	bgc-0003
Philippians-4-21	Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you.	Philippians 4 : 21	Flowers_0001_289	bgc-0004
Philippians-4-22	All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesarâ€™s household.	Philippians 4 : 22	Flowers_0001_290	bgc-0005
Philippians-4-23	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with you all. Amen. 	Philippians 4 : 23	Flowers_0001_291	bgc-0006
Colossians-1-1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus <i>our</i> brother,	Colossians 1 : 1	Flowers_0001_292	bgc-0007
Colossians-1-2	To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace <i>be</i> unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	Colossians 1 : 2	Flowers_0001_293	bgc-0008
Colossians-1-3	We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,	Colossians 1 : 3	Flowers_0001_294	bgc-0009
Colossians-1-4	Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love <i>which ye have</i> to all the saints,	Colossians 1 : 4	Flowers_0001_295	bgc-0010
Colossians-1-5	For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;	Colossians 1 : 5	Flowers_0001_296	bgc-0011
Colossians-1-6	Which is come unto you, as <i>it is</i> in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as <i>it doth</i> also in you, since the day ye heard <i>of it</i>, and knew the grace of God in truth:	Colossians 1 : 6	Flowers_0001_297	bgc-0012
Colossians-1-7	As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;	Colossians 1 : 7	Flowers_0001_298	bgc-0013
Colossians-1-8	Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.	Colossians 1 : 8	Flowers_0001_299	bgc-0014
Colossians-1-9	For this cause we also, since the day we heard <i>it</i>, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;	Colossians 1 : 9	Flowers_0001_300	bgc-0015
Colossians-1-10	That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;	Colossians 1 : 10	Flowers_0001_301	bgc-0016
Colossians-1-11	Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;	Colossians 1 : 11	Flowers_0001_302	bgc-0003
Colossians-1-12	Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:	Colossians 1 : 12	Flowers_0001_303	bgc-0004
Colossians-1-13	Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated <i>us</i> into the kingdom of his dear Son:	Colossians 1 : 13	Flowers_0001_304	bgc-0005
Colossians-1-14	In whom we have redemption through his blood, <i>even</i> the forgiveness of sins:	Colossians 1 : 14	Flowers_0001_305	bgc-0006
Colossians-1-15	Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:	Colossians 1 : 15	Flowers_0001_306	bgc-0007
Colossians-1-16	For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether <i>they be</i> thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:	Colossians 1 : 16	Flowers_0001_307	bgc-0008
Colossians-1-17	And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.	Colossians 1 : 17	Flowers_0001_308	bgc-0009
Colossians-1-18	And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all <i>things</i> he might have the preeminence.	Colossians 1 : 18	Flowers_0001_309	bgc-0010
Colossians-1-19	For it pleased <i>the Father</i> that in him should all fulness dwell;	Colossians 1 : 19	Flowers_0001_310	bgc-0011
Colossians-1-20	And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, <i>I say</i>, whether <i>they be</i> things in earth, or things in heaven.	Colossians 1 : 20	Flowers_0001_311	bgc-0012
Colossians-1-21	And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in <i>your</i> mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled	Colossians 1 : 21	Flowers_0001_312	bgc-0013
Colossians-1-22	In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:	Colossians 1 : 22	Flowers_0001_313	bgc-0014
Colossians-1-23	If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and <i>be</i> not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, <i>and</i> which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;	Colossians 1 : 23	Flowers_0001_314	bgc-0015
Colossians-1-24	Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his bodyâ€™s sake, which is the church:	Colossians 1 : 24	Flowers_0001_315	bgc-0016
Colossians-1-25	Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;	Colossians 1 : 25	Flowers_0001_316	bgc-0003
Colossians-1-26	<i>Even</i> the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:	Colossians 1 : 26	Flowers_0001_317	bgc-0004
Colossians-1-27	To whom God would make known what <i>is</i> the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:	Colossians 1 : 27	Flowers_0001_318	bgc-0005
Colossians-1-28	Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:	Colossians 1 : 28	Flowers_0001_319	bgc-0006
Colossians-1-29	Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily.	Colossians 1 : 29	Flowers_0001_320	bgc-0007
Colossians-2-1	For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and <i>for</i> them at Laodicea, and <i>for</i> as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;	Colossians 2 : 1	Flowers_0001_321	bgc-0008
Colossians-2-2	That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;	Colossians 2 : 2	Flowers_0001_322	bgc-0009
Colossians-2-3	In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.	Colossians 2 : 3	Flowers_0001_323	bgc-0010
Colossians-2-4	And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words.	Colossians 2 : 4	Flowers_0001_324	bgc-0011
Colossians-2-5	For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ.	Colossians 2 : 5	Flowers_0001_325	bgc-0012
Colossians-2-6	As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, <i>so</i> walk ye in him:	Colossians 2 : 6	Flowers_0001_326	bgc-0013
Colossians-2-7	Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.	Colossians 2 : 7	Flowers_0001_327	bgc-0014
Colossians-2-8	Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.	Colossians 2 : 8	Flowers_0001_328	bgc-0015
Colossians-2-9	For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.	Colossians 2 : 9	Flowers_0001_329	bgc-0016
Colossians-2-10	And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:	Colossians 2 : 10	Flowers_0001_330	bgc-0003
Colossians-2-11	In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:	Colossians 2 : 11	Flowers_0001_331	bgc-0004
Colossians-2-12	Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with <i>him</i> through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead.	Colossians 2 : 12	Flowers_0001_332	bgc-0005
Colossians-2-13	And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;	Colossians 2 : 13	Flowers_0001_333	bgc-0006
Colossians-2-14	Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;	Colossians 2 : 14	Flowers_0001_334	bgc-0007
Colossians-2-15	<i>And</i> having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.	Colossians 2 : 15	Flowers_0001_335	bgc-0008
Colossians-2-16	Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath <i>days</i>:	Colossians 2 : 16	Flowers_0001_336	bgc-0009
Colossians-2-17	Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body <i>is</i> of Christ.	Colossians 2 : 17	Flowers_0001_337	bgc-0010
Colossians-2-18	Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,	Colossians 2 : 18	Flowers_0001_338	bgc-0011
Colossians-2-19	And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.	Colossians 2 : 19	Flowers_0001_339	bgc-0012
Colossians-2-20	Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,	Colossians 2 : 20	Flowers_0001_340	bgc-0013
Colossians-2-21	Touch not; taste not; handle not;	Colossians 2 : 21	Flowers_0001_341	bgc-0014
Colossians-2-22	Which all are to perish with the using; after the commandments and doctrines of men?	Colossians 2 : 22	Flowers_0001_342	bgc-0015
Colossians-2-23	Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body; not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh.	Colossians 2 : 23	Flowers_0001_343	bgc-0016
Colossians-3-1	If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.	Colossians 3 : 1	Flowers_0001_1	bgc-0003
Colossians-3-2	Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.	Colossians 3 : 2	Flowers_0001_2	bgc-0004
Colossians-3-3	For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.	Colossians 3 : 3	Flowers_0001_3	bgc-0005
Colossians-3-4	When Christ, <i>who is</i> our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.	Colossians 3 : 4	Flowers_0001_4	bgc-0006
Colossians-3-5	Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:	Colossians 3 : 5	Flowers_0001_5	bgc-0007
Colossians-3-6	For which thingsâ€™ sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:	Colossians 3 : 6	Flowers_0001_6	bgc-0008
Colossians-3-7	In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.	Colossians 3 : 7	Flowers_0001_7	bgc-0009
Colossians-3-8	But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.	Colossians 3 : 8	Flowers_0001_8	bgc-0010
Colossians-3-9	Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;	Colossians 3 : 9	Flowers_0001_9	bgc-0011
Colossians-3-10	And have put on the new <i>man</i>, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:	Colossians 3 : 10	Flowers_0001_10	bgc-0012
Colossians-3-11	Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond <i>nor</i> free: but Christ <i>is</i> all, and in all.	Colossians 3 : 11	Flowers_0001_11	bgc-0013

1-Thessalonians-1-2	We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;	1-Thessalonians 1 : 2	Flowers_0001_45	bgc-0005
1-Thessalonians-1-3	Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;	1-Thessalonians 1 : 3	Flowers_0001_46	bgc-0006
1-Thessalonians-1-4	Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.	1-Thessalonians 1 : 4	Flowers_0001_47	bgc-0007
1-Thessalonians-1-5	For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.	1-Thessalonians 1 : 5	Flowers_0001_48	bgc-0008
1-Thessalonians-1-6	And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost:	1-Thessalonians 1 : 6	Flowers_0001_49	bgc-0009
1-Thessalonians-1-7	So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.	1-Thessalonians 1 : 7	Flowers_0001_50	bgc-0010
1-Thessalonians-1-8	For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.	1-Thessalonians 1 : 8	Flowers_0001_51	bgc-0011
1-Thessalonians-1-9	For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;	1-Thessalonians 1 : 9	Flowers_0001_52	bgc-0012
1-Thessalonians-1-10	And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, <i>even</i> Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.	1-Thessalonians 1 : 10	Flowers_0001_53	bgc-0013
1-Thessalonians-2-1	For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in unto you, that it was not in vain:	1-Thessalonians 2 : 1	Flowers_0001_54	bgc-0014
1-Thessalonians-2-2	But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention.	1-Thessalonians 2 : 2	Flowers_0001_55	bgc-0015
1-Thessalonians-2-3	For our exhortation <i>was</i> not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in guile:	1-Thessalonians 2 : 3	Flowers_0001_56	bgc-0016
1-Thessalonians-2-4	But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel, even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our hearts.	1-Thessalonians 2 : 4	Flowers_0001_57	bgc-0003
1-Thessalonians-2-5	For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God <i>is</i> witness:	1-Thessalonians 2 : 5	Flowers_0001_58	bgc-0004
1-Thessalonians-2-6	Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor <i>yet</i> of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.	1-Thessalonians 2 : 6	Flowers_0001_59	bgc-0005
1-Thessalonians-2-7	But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:	1-Thessalonians 2 : 7	Flowers_0001_60	bgc-0006
1-Thessalonians-2-8	So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us.	1-Thessalonians 2 : 8	Flowers_0001_61	bgc-0007
1-Thessalonians-2-9	For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.	1-Thessalonians 2 : 9	Flowers_0001_62	bgc-0008
1-Thessalonians-2-10	Ye <i>are</i> witnesses, and God <i>also</i>, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:	1-Thessalonians 2 : 10	Flowers_0001_63	bgc-0009
1-Thessalonians-2-11	As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father <i>doth</i> his children,	1-Thessalonians 2 : 11	Flowers_0001_64	bgc-0010
1-Thessalonians-2-12	That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.	1-Thessalonians 2 : 12	Flowers_0001_65	bgc-0011
1-Thessalonians-2-13	For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received <i>it</i> not <i>as</i> the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.	1-Thessalonians 2 : 13	Flowers_0001_66	bgc-0012
1-Thessalonians-2-14	For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they <i>have</i> of the Jews:	1-Thessalonians 2 : 14	Flowers_0001_67	bgc-0013
1-Thessalonians-2-15	Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:	1-Thessalonians 2 : 15	Flowers_0001_68	bgc-0014
1-Thessalonians-2-16	Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.	1-Thessalonians 2 : 16	Flowers_0001_69	bgc-0015
1-Thessalonians-2-17	But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.	1-Thessalonians 2 : 17	Flowers_0001_70	bgc-0016
1-Thessalonians-2-18	Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.	1-Thessalonians 2 : 18	Flowers_0001_71	bgc-0003
1-Thessalonians-2-19	For what <i>is</i> our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? <i>Are</i> not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?	1-Thessalonians 2 : 19	Flowers_0001_72	bgc-0004
1-Thessalonians-2-20	For ye are our glory and joy.	1-Thessalonians 2 : 20	Flowers_0001_73	bgc-0005
1-Thessalonians-3-1	Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;	1-Thessalonians 3 : 1	Flowers_0001_74	bgc-0006
1-Thessalonians-3-2	And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:	1-Thessalonians 3 : 2	Flowers_0001_75	bgc-0007
1-Thessalonians-3-3	That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.	1-Thessalonians 3 : 3	Flowers_0001_76	bgc-0008
1-Thessalonians-3-4	For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.	1-Thessalonians 3 : 4	Flowers_0001_77	bgc-0009
1-Thessalonians-3-5	For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.	1-Thessalonians 3 : 5	Flowers_0001_78	bgc-0010
1-Thessalonians-3-6	But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also <i>to see</i> you:	1-Thessalonians 3 : 6	Flowers_0001_79	bgc-0011
1-Thessalonians-3-7	Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:	1-Thessalonians 3 : 7	Flowers_0001_80	bgc-0012
1-Thessalonians-3-8	For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.	1-Thessalonians 3 : 8	Flowers_0001_81	bgc-0013
1-Thessalonians-3-9	For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;	1-Thessalonians 3 : 9	Flowers_0001_82	bgc-0014
1-Thessalonians-3-10	Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?	1-Thessalonians 3 : 10	Flowers_0001_83	bgc-0015
1-Thessalonians-3-11	Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.	1-Thessalonians 3 : 11	Flowers_0001_84	bgc-0016
1-Thessalonians-3-12	And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all <i>men</i>, even as we <i>do</i> toward you:	1-Thessalonians 3 : 12	Flowers_0001_85	bgc-0003
1-Thessalonians-3-13	To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.	1-Thessalonians 3 : 13	Flowers_0001_86	bgc-0004
1-Thessalonians-4-1	Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort <i>you</i> by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, <i>so</i> ye would abound more and more.	1-Thessalonians 4 : 1	Flowers_0001_87	bgc-0005
1-Thessalonians-4-2	For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.	1-Thessalonians 4 : 2	Flowers_0001_88	bgc-0006
1-Thessalonians-4-3	For this is the will of God, <i>even</i> your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:	1-Thessalonians 4 : 3	Flowers_0001_89	bgc-0007
1-Thessalonians-4-4	That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;	1-Thessalonians 4 : 4	Flowers_0001_90	bgc-0008
1-Thessalonians-4-5	Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:	1-Thessalonians 4 : 5	Flowers_0001_91	bgc-0009
1-Thessalonians-4-6	That no <i>man</i> go beyond and defraud his brother in <i>any</i> matter: because that the Lord <i>is</i> the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.	1-Thessalonians 4 : 6	Flowers_0001_92	bgc-0010
1-Thessalonians-4-7	For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.	1-Thessalonians 4 : 7	Flowers_0001_93	bgc-0011
1-Thessalonians-4-8	He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.	1-Thessalonians 4 : 8	Flowers_0001_94	bgc-0012
1-Thessalonians-4-9	But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.	1-Thessalonians 4 : 9	Flowers_0001_95	bgc-0013
1-Thessalonians-4-10	And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;	1-Thessalonians 4 : 10	Flowers_0001_96	bgc-0014
1-Thessalonians-4-11	And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;	1-Thessalonians 4 : 11	Flowers_0001_97	bgc-0015
1-Thessalonians-4-12	That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and <i>that</i> ye may have lack of nothing.	1-Thessalonians 4 : 12	Flowers_0001_98	bgc-0016
1-Thessalonians-4-13	But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.	1-Thessalonians 4 : 13	Flowers_0001_99	bgc-0003
1-Thessalonians-4-14	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.	1-Thessalonians 4 : 14	Flowers_0001_100	bgc-0004
1-Thessalonians-4-15	For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive <i>and</i> remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.	1-Thessalonians 4 : 15	Flowers_0001_101	bgc-0005
1-Thessalonians-4-16	For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:	1-Thessalonians 4 : 16	Flowers_0001_102	bgc-0006
1-Thessalonians-4-17	Then we which are alive <i>and</i> remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.	1-Thessalonians 4 : 17	Flowers_0001_103	bgc-0007
1-Thessalonians-4-18	Wherefore comfort one another with these words.	1-Thessalonians 4 : 18	Flowers_0001_104	bgc-0008
1-Thessalonians-5-1	But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.	1-Thessalonians 5 : 1	Flowers_0001_105	bgc-0009
1-Thessalonians-5-2	For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.	1-Thessalonians 5 : 2	Flowers_0001_106	bgc-0010
1-Thessalonians-5-3	For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.	1-Thessalonians 5 : 3	Flowers_0001_107	bgc-0011
1-Thessalonians-5-4	But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.	1-Thessalonians 5 : 4	Flowers_0001_108	bgc-0012
1-Thessalonians-5-5	Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.	1-Thessalonians 5 : 5	Flowers_0001_109	bgc-0013
1-Thessalonians-5-6	Therefore let us not sleep, as <i>do</i> others; but let us watch and be sober.	1-Thessalonians 5 : 6	Flowers_0001_110	bgc-0014
1-Thessalonians-5-7	For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.	1-Thessalonians 5 : 7	Flowers_0001_111	bgc-0015
1-Thessalonians-5-8	But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.	1-Thessalonians 5 : 8	Flowers_0001_112	bgc-0016
1-Thessalonians-5-9	For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,	1-Thessalonians 5 : 9	Flowers_0001_113	bgc-0003
1-Thessalonians-5-10	Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.	1-Thessalonians 5 : 10	Flowers_0001_114	bgc-0004
1-Thessalonians-5-11	Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.	1-Thessalonians 5 : 11	Flowers_0001_115	bgc-0005
1-Thessalonians-5-12	And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;	1-Thessalonians 5 : 12	Flowers_0001_116	bgc-0006
1-Thessalonians-5-13	And to esteem them very highly in love for their workâ€™s sake. <i>And</i> be at peace among yourselves.	1-Thessalonians 5 : 13	Flowers_0001_117	bgc-0007
1-Thessalonians-5-14	Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all <i>men</i>.	1-Thessalonians 5 : 14	Flowers_0001_118	bgc-0008
1-Thessalonians-5-15	See that none render evil for evil unto any <i>man</i>; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all <i>men</i>.	1-Thessalonians 5 : 15	Flowers_0001_119	bgc-0009
1-Thessalonians-5-16	Rejoice evermore.	1-Thessalonians 5 : 16	Flowers_0001_120	bgc-0010
1-Thessalonians-5-17	Pray without ceasing.	1-Thessalonians 5 : 17	Flowers_0001_121	bgc-0011
1-Thessalonians-5-18	In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.	1-Thessalonians 5 : 18	Flowers_0001_122	bgc-0012
1-Thessalonians-5-19	Quench not the Spirit.	1-Thessalonians 5 : 19	Flowers_0001_123	bgc-0013
1-Thessalonians-5-20	Despise not prophesyings.	1-Thessalonians 5 : 20	Flowers_0001_124	bgc-0014
1-Thessalonians-5-21	Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.	1-Thessalonians 5 : 21	Flowers_0001_125	bgc-0015
1-Thessalonians-5-22	Abstain from all appearance of evil.	1-Thessalonians 5 : 22	Flowers_0001_126	bgc-0016
1-Thessalonians-5-23	And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and <i>I pray God</i> your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.	1-Thessalonians 5 : 23	Flowers_0001_127	bgc-0003
1-Thessalonians-5-24	Faithful <i>is</i> he that calleth you, who also will do <i>it</i>.	1-Thessalonians 5 : 24	Flowers_0001_128	bgc-0004
1-Thessalonians-5-25	Brethren, pray for us.	1-Thessalonians 5 : 25	Flowers_0001_129	bgc-0005
1-Thessalonians-5-26	Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.	1-Thessalonians 5 : 26	Flowers_0001_130	bgc-0006
1-Thessalonians-5-27	I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.	1-Thessalonians 5 : 27	Flowers_0001_131	bgc-0007
1-Thessalonians-5-28	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with you. Amen. 	1-Thessalonians 5 : 28	Flowers_0001_132	bgc-0008
2-Thessalonians-1-1	Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:	2-Thessalonians 1 : 1	Flowers_0001_133	bgc-0009
2-Thessalonians-1-2	Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	2-Thessalonians 1 : 2	Flowers_0001_134	bgc-0010
2-Thessalonians-1-3	We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;	2-Thessalonians 1 : 3	Flowers_0001_135	bgc-0011
2-Thessalonians-1-4	So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:	2-Thessalonians 1 : 4	Flowers_0001_136	bgc-0012
2-Thessalonians-1-5	<i>Which is</i> a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:	2-Thessalonians 1 : 5	Flowers_0001_137	bgc-0013
2-Thessalonians-1-6	Seeing <i>it is</i> a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;	2-Thessalonians 1 : 6	Flowers_0001_138	bgc-0014
2-Thessalonians-1-7	And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,	2-Thessalonians 1 : 7	Flowers_0001_139	bgc-0015
2-Thessalonians-1-8	In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:	2-Thessalonians 1 : 8	Flowers_0001_140	bgc-0016
2-Thessalonians-1-9	Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;	2-Thessalonians 1 : 9	Flowers_0001_141	bgc-0003
2-Thessalonians-1-10	When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.	2-Thessalonians 1 : 10	Flowers_0001_142	bgc-0004
2-Thessalonians-1-11	Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of <i>this</i> calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of <i>his</i> goodness, and the work of faith with power:	2-Thessalonians 1 : 11	Flowers_0001_143	bgc-0005
2-Thessalonians-1-12	That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.	2-Thessalonians 1 : 12	Flowers_0001_144	bgc-0006
2-Thessalonians-2-1	Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and <i>by</i> our gathering together unto him,	2-Thessalonians 2 : 1	Flowers_0001_145	bgc-0007
2-Thessalonians-2-2	That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.	2-Thessalonians 2 : 2	Flowers_0001_146	bgc-0008
2-Thessalonians-2-3	Let no man deceive you by any means: for <i>that day shall not come</i>, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;	2-Thessalonians 2 : 3	Flowers_0001_147	bgc-0009
2-Thessalonians-2-4	Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.	2-Thessalonians 2 : 4	Flowers_0001_148	bgc-0010
2-Thessalonians-2-5	Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?	2-Thessalonians 2 : 5	Flowers_0001_149	bgc-0011
2-Thessalonians-2-6	And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time.	2-Thessalonians 2 : 6	Flowers_0001_150	bgc-0012
2-Thessalonians-2-7	For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth <i>will let</i>, until he be taken out of the way.	2-Thessalonians 2 : 7	Flowers_0001_151	bgc-0013
2-Thessalonians-2-8	And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:	2-Thessalonians 2 : 8	Flowers_0001_152	bgc-0014
2-Thessalonians-2-9	<i>Even him</i>, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,	2-Thessalonians 2 : 9	Flowers_0001_153	bgc-0015
2-Thessalonians-2-10	And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.	2-Thessalonians 2 : 10	Flowers_0001_154	bgc-0016
2-Thessalonians-2-11	And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:	2-Thessalonians 2 : 11	Flowers_0001_155	bgc-0003
2-Thessalonians-2-12	That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.	2-Thessalonians 2 : 12	Flowers_0001_156	bgc-0004
2-Thessalonians-2-13	But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:	2-Thessalonians 2 : 13	Flowers_0001_157	bgc-0005
2-Thessalonians-2-14	Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.	2-Thessalonians 2 : 14	Flowers_0001_158	bgc-0006
2-Thessalonians-2-15	Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.	2-Thessalonians 2 : 15	Flowers_0001_159	bgc-0007
2-Thessalonians-2-16	Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given <i>us</i> everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,	2-Thessalonians 2 : 16	Flowers_0001_160	bgc-0008
2-Thessalonians-2-17	Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work.	2-Thessalonians 2 : 17	Flowers_0001_161	bgc-0009
2-Thessalonians-3-1	Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have <i>free</i> course, and be glorified, even as <i>it is</i> with you:	2-Thessalonians 3 : 1	Flowers_0001_162	bgc-0010
2-Thessalonians-3-2	And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all <i>men</i> have not faith.	2-Thessalonians 3 : 2	Flowers_0001_163	bgc-0011
2-Thessalonians-3-3	But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep <i>you</i> from evil.	2-Thessalonians 3 : 3	Flowers_0001_164	bgc-0012
2-Thessalonians-3-4	And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you.	2-Thessalonians 3 : 4	Flowers_0001_165	bgc-0013
2-Thessalonians-3-5	And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ.	2-Thessalonians 3 : 5	Flowers_0001_166	bgc-0014
2-Thessalonians-3-6	Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.	2-Thessalonians 3 : 6	Flowers_0001_167	bgc-0015
2-Thessalonians-3-7	For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;	2-Thessalonians 3 : 7	Flowers_0001_168	bgc-0016
2-Thessalonians-3-8	Neither did we eat any manâ€™s bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:	2-Thessalonians 3 : 8	Flowers_0001_169	bgc-0003
2-Thessalonians-3-9	Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us.	2-Thessalonians 3 : 9	Flowers_0001_170	bgc-0004
2-Thessalonians-3-10	For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.	2-Thessalonians 3 : 10	Flowers_0001_171	bgc-0005
2-Thessalonians-3-11	For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies.	2-Thessalonians 3 : 11	Flowers_0001_172	bgc-0006
2-Thessalonians-3-12	Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.	2-Thessalonians 3 : 12	Flowers_0001_173	bgc-0007
2-Thessalonians-3-13	But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.	2-Thessalonians 3 : 13	Flowers_0001_174	bgc-0008
2-Thessalonians-3-14	And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed.	2-Thessalonians 3 : 14	Flowers_0001_175	bgc-0009
2-Thessalonians-3-15	Yet count <i>him</i> not as an enemy, but admonish <i>him</i> as a brother.	2-Thessalonians 3 : 15	Flowers_0001_176	bgc-0010
2-Thessalonians-3-16	Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord <i>be</i> with you all.	2-Thessalonians 3 : 16	Flowers_0001_177	bgc-0011
2-Thessalonians-3-17	The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write.	2-Thessalonians 3 : 17	Flowers_0001_178	bgc-0012
2-Thessalonians-3-18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with you all. Amen. 	2-Thessalonians 3 : 18	Flowers_0001_179	bgc-0013
1-Timothy-1-1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, <i>which is</i> our hope;	1-Timothy 1 : 1	Flowers_0001_180	bgc-0014
1-Timothy-1-2	Unto Timothy, <i>my</i> own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, <i>and</i> peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.	1-Timothy 1 : 2	Flowers_0001_181	bgc-0015
1-Timothy-1-3	As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,	1-Timothy 1 : 3	Flowers_0001_182	bgc-0016
1-Timothy-1-4	Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: <i>so do</i>.	1-Timothy 1 : 4	Flowers_0001_183	bgc-0003
1-Timothy-1-5	Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and <i>of</i> a good conscience, and <i>of</i> faith unfeigned:	1-Timothy 1 : 5	Flowers_0001_184	bgc-0004
1-Timothy-1-6	From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;	1-Timothy 1 : 6	Flowers_0001_185	bgc-0005
1-Timothy-1-7	Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.	1-Timothy 1 : 7	Flowers_0001_186	bgc-0006
1-Timothy-1-8	But we know that the law <i>is</i> good, if a man use it lawfully;	1-Timothy 1 : 8	Flowers_0001_187	bgc-0007
1-Timothy-1-9	Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,	1-Timothy 1 : 9	Flowers_0001_188	bgc-0008
1-Timothy-1-10	For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;	1-Timothy 1 : 10	Flowers_0001_189	bgc-0009
1-Timothy-1-11	According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.	1-Timothy 1 : 11	Flowers_0001_190	bgc-0010
1-Timothy-1-12	And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;	1-Timothy 1 : 12	Flowers_0001_191	bgc-0011
1-Timothy-1-13	Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did <i>it</i> ignorantly in unbelief.	1-Timothy 1 : 13	Flowers_0001_192	bgc-0012
1-Timothy-1-14	And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.	1-Timothy 1 : 14	Flowers_0001_193	bgc-0013
1-Timothy-1-15	This <i>is</i> a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.	1-Timothy 1 : 15	Flowers_0001_194	bgc-0014
1-Timothy-1-16	Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.	1-Timothy 1 : 16	Flowers_0001_195	bgc-0015
1-Timothy-1-17	Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, <i>be</i> honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.	1-Timothy 1 : 17	Flowers_0001_196	bgc-0016
1-Timothy-1-18	This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;	1-Timothy 1 : 18	Flowers_0001_197	bgc-0003
1-Timothy-1-19	Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:	1-Timothy 1 : 19	Flowers_0001_198	bgc-0004
1-Timothy-1-20	Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.	1-Timothy 1 : 20	Flowers_0001_199	bgc-0005
1-Timothy-2-1	I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, <i>and</i> giving of thanks, be made for all men;	1-Timothy 2 : 1	Flowers_0001_200	bgc-0006
1-Timothy-2-2	For kings, and <i>for</i> all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.	1-Timothy 2 : 2	Flowers_0001_201	bgc-0007
1-Timothy-2-3	For this <i>is</i> good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;	1-Timothy 2 : 3	Flowers_0001_202	bgc-0008
1-Timothy-2-4	Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.	1-Timothy 2 : 4	Flowers_0001_203	bgc-0009
1-Timothy-2-5	For <i>there is</i> one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;	1-Timothy 2 : 5	Flowers_0001_204	bgc-0010
1-Timothy-2-6	Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.	1-Timothy 2 : 6	Flowers_0001_205	bgc-0011
1-Timothy-2-7	Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, <i>and</i> lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.	1-Timothy 2 : 7	Flowers_0001_206	bgc-0012
1-Timothy-2-8	I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.	1-Timothy 2 : 8	Flowers_0001_207	bgc-0013
1-Timothy-2-9	In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;	1-Timothy 2 : 9	Flowers_0001_208	bgc-0014
1-Timothy-2-10	But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.	1-Timothy 2 : 10	Flowers_0001_209	bgc-0015
1-Timothy-2-11	Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.	1-Timothy 2 : 11	Flowers_0001_210	bgc-0016
1-Timothy-2-12	But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.	1-Timothy 2 : 12	Flowers_0001_211	bgc-0003
1-Timothy-2-13	For Adam was first formed, then Eve.	1-Timothy 2 : 13	Flowers_0001_212	bgc-0004
1-Timothy-2-14	And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.	1-Timothy 2 : 14	Flowers_0001_213	bgc-0005
1-Timothy-2-15	Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.	1-Timothy 2 : 15	Flowers_0001_214	bgc-0006
1-Timothy-3-1	This <i>is</i> a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.	1-Timothy 3 : 1	Flowers_0001_215	bgc-0007
1-Timothy-3-2	A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;	1-Timothy 3 : 2	Flowers_0001_216	bgc-0008
1-Timothy-3-3	Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;	1-Timothy 3 : 3	Flowers_0001_217	bgc-0009
1-Timothy-3-4	One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;	1-Timothy 3 : 4	Flowers_0001_218	bgc-0010
1-Timothy-3-5	(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)	1-Timothy 3 : 5	Flowers_0001_219	bgc-0011
1-Timothy-3-6	Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.	1-Timothy 3 : 6	Flowers_0001_220	bgc-0012
1-Timothy-3-7	Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.	1-Timothy 3 : 7	Flowers_0001_221	bgc-0013
1-Timothy-3-8	Likewise <i>must</i> the deacons <i>be</i> grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;	1-Timothy 3 : 8	Flowers_0001_222	bgc-0014
1-Timothy-3-9	Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.	1-Timothy 3 : 9	Flowers_0001_223	bgc-0015
1-Timothy-3-10	And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being <i>found</i> blameless.	1-Timothy 3 : 10	Flowers_0001_224	bgc-0016
1-Timothy-3-11	Even so <i>must their</i> wives <i>be</i> grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.	1-Timothy 3 : 11	Flowers_0001_225	bgc-0003
1-Timothy-3-12	Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.	1-Timothy 3 : 12	Flowers_0001_226	bgc-0004
1-Timothy-3-13	For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.	1-Timothy 3 : 13	Flowers_0001_227	bgc-0005
1-Timothy-3-14	These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:	1-Timothy 3 : 14	Flowers_0001_228	bgc-0006
1-Timothy-3-15	But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.	1-Timothy 3 : 15	Flowers_0001_229	bgc-0007
1-Timothy-3-16	And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.	1-Timothy 3 : 16	Flowers_0001_230	bgc-0008
1-Timothy-4-1	Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;	1-Timothy 4 : 1	Flowers_0001_231	bgc-0009
1-Timothy-4-2	Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;	1-Timothy 4 : 2	Flowers_0001_232	bgc-0010
1-Timothy-4-3	Forbidding to marry, <i>and commanding</i> to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.	1-Timothy 4 : 3	Flowers_0001_233	bgc-0011
1-Timothy-4-4	For every creature of God <i>is</i> good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:	1-Timothy 4 : 4	Flowers_0001_234	bgc-0012
1-Timothy-4-5	For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.	1-Timothy 4 : 5	Flowers_0001_235	bgc-0013
1-Timothy-4-6	If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.	1-Timothy 4 : 6	Flowers_0001_236	bgc-0014
1-Timothy-4-7	But refuse profane and old wivesâ€™ fables, and exercise thyself <i>rather</i> unto godliness.	1-Timothy 4 : 7	Flowers_0001_237	bgc-0015
1-Timothy-4-8	For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.	1-Timothy 4 : 8	Flowers_0001_238	bgc-0016
1-Timothy-4-9	This <i>is</i> a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.	1-Timothy 4 : 9	Flowers_0001_239	bgc-0003
1-Timothy-4-10	For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.	1-Timothy 4 : 10	Flowers_0001_240	bgc-0004
1-Timothy-4-11	These things command and teach.	1-Timothy 4 : 11	Flowers_0001_241	bgc-0005
1-Timothy-4-12	Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.	1-Timothy 4 : 12	Flowers_0001_242	bgc-0006
1-Timothy-4-13	Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.	1-Timothy 4 : 13	Flowers_0001_243	bgc-0007
1-Timothy-4-14	Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.	1-Timothy 4 : 14	Flowers_0001_244	bgc-0008
1-Timothy-4-15	Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.	1-Timothy 4 : 15	Flowers_0001_245	bgc-0009
1-Timothy-4-16	Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.	1-Timothy 4 : 16	Flowers_0001_246	bgc-0010
1-Timothy-5-1	Rebuke not an elder, but intreat <i>him</i> as a father; <i>and</i> the younger men as brethren;	1-Timothy 5 : 1	Flowers_0001_247	bgc-0011
1-Timothy-5-2	The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.	1-Timothy 5 : 2	Flowers_0001_248	bgc-0012
1-Timothy-5-3	Honour widows that are widows indeed.	1-Timothy 5 : 3	Flowers_0001_249	bgc-0013
1-Timothy-5-4	But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.	1-Timothy 5 : 4	Flowers_0001_250	bgc-0014
1-Timothy-5-5	Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day.	1-Timothy 5 : 5	Flowers_0001_251	bgc-0015
1-Timothy-5-6	But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.	1-Timothy 5 : 6	Flowers_0001_252	bgc-0016
1-Timothy-5-7	And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.	1-Timothy 5 : 7	Flowers_0001_253	bgc-0003
1-Timothy-5-8	But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.	1-Timothy 5 : 8	Flowers_0001_254	bgc-0004
1-Timothy-5-9	Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man,	1-Timothy 5 : 9	Flowers_0001_255	bgc-0005
1-Timothy-5-10	Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saintsâ€™ feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.	1-Timothy 5 : 10	Flowers_0001_256	bgc-0006
1-Timothy-5-11	But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;	1-Timothy 5 : 11	Flowers_0001_257	bgc-0007
1-Timothy-5-12	Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith.	1-Timothy 5 : 12	Flowers_0001_258	bgc-0008
1-Timothy-5-13	And withal they learn <i>to be</i> idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.	1-Timothy 5 : 13	Flowers_0001_259	bgc-0009
1-Timothy-5-14	I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.	1-Timothy 5 : 14	Flowers_0001_260	bgc-0010
1-Timothy-5-15	For some are already turned aside after Satan.	1-Timothy 5 : 15	Flowers_0001_261	bgc-0011
1-Timothy-5-16	If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.	1-Timothy 5 : 16	Flowers_0001_262	bgc-0012
1-Timothy-5-17	Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine.	1-Timothy 5 : 17	Flowers_0001_263	bgc-0013
1-Timothy-5-18	For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer <i>is</i> worthy of his reward.	1-Timothy 5 : 18	Flowers_0001_264	bgc-0014
1-Timothy-5-19	Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.	1-Timothy 5 : 19	Flowers_0001_265	bgc-0015
1-Timothy-5-20	Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.	1-Timothy 5 : 20	Flowers_0001_266	bgc-0016
1-Timothy-5-21	I charge <i>thee</i> before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.	1-Timothy 5 : 21	Flowers_0001_267	bgc-0003
1-Timothy-5-22	Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other menâ€™s sins: keep thyself pure.	1-Timothy 5 : 22	Flowers_0001_268	bgc-0004
1-Timothy-5-23	Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomachâ€™s sake and thine often infirmities.	1-Timothy 5 : 23	Flowers_0001_269	bgc-0005
1-Timothy-5-24	Some menâ€™s sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some <i>men</i> they follow after.	1-Timothy 5 : 24	Flowers_0001_270	bgc-0006
1-Timothy-5-25	Likewise also the good works <i>of some</i> are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.	1-Timothy 5 : 25	Flowers_0001_271	bgc-0007
1-Timothy-6-1	Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and <i>his</i> doctrine be not blasphemed.	1-Timothy 6 : 1	Flowers_0001_272	bgc-0008
1-Timothy-6-2	And they that have believing masters, let them not despise <i>them</i>, because they are brethren; but rather do <i>them</i> service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.	1-Timothy 6 : 2	Flowers_0001_273	bgc-0009
1-Timothy-6-3	If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, <i>even</i> the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;	1-Timothy 6 : 3	Flowers_0001_274	bgc-0010
1-Timothy-6-4	He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,	1-Timothy 6 : 4	Flowers_0001_275	bgc-0011
1-Timothy-6-5	Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself.	1-Timothy 6 : 5	Flowers_0001_276	bgc-0012
1-Timothy-6-6	But godliness with contentment is great gain.	1-Timothy 6 : 6	Flowers_0001_277	bgc-0013
1-Timothy-6-7	For we brought nothing into <i>this</i> world, <i>and it is</i> certain we can carry nothing out.	1-Timothy 6 : 7	Flowers_0001_278	bgc-0014
1-Timothy-6-8	And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.	1-Timothy 6 : 8	Flowers_0001_279	bgc-0015
1-Timothy-6-9	But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and <i>into</i> many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.	1-Timothy 6 : 9	Flowers_0001_280	bgc-0016
1-Timothy-6-10	For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.	1-Timothy 6 : 10	Flowers_0001_281	bgc-0003
1-Timothy-6-11	But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.	1-Timothy 6 : 11	Flowers_0001_282	bgc-0004
1-Timothy-6-12	Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.	1-Timothy 6 : 12	Flowers_0001_283	bgc-0005
1-Timothy-6-13	I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and <i>before</i> Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;	1-Timothy 6 : 13	Flowers_0001_284	bgc-0006
1-Timothy-6-14	That thou keep <i>this</i> commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:	1-Timothy 6 : 14	Flowers_0001_285	bgc-0007
1-Timothy-6-15	Which in his times he shall shew, <i>who is</i> the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;	1-Timothy 6 : 15	Flowers_0001_286	bgc-0008
1-Timothy-6-16	Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom <i>be</i> honour and power everlasting. Amen.	1-Timothy 6 : 16	Flowers_0001_287	bgc-0009
1-Timothy-6-17	Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;	1-Timothy 6 : 17	Flowers_0001_288	bgc-0010
1-Timothy-6-18	That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;	1-Timothy 6 : 18	Flowers_0001_289	bgc-0011
1-Timothy-6-19	Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.	1-Timothy 6 : 19	Flowers_0001_290	bgc-0012
1-Timothy-6-20	O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane <i>and</i> vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:	1-Timothy 6 : 20	Flowers_0001_291	bgc-0013
1-Timothy-6-21	Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace <i>be</i> with thee. Amen. 	1-Timothy 6 : 21	Flowers_0001_292	bgc-0014
2-Timothy-1-1	Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,	2-Timothy 1 : 1	Flowers_0001_293	bgc-0015
2-Timothy-1-2	To Timothy, <i>my</i> dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, <i>and</i> peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.	2-Timothy 1 : 2	Flowers_0001_294	bgc-0016
2-Timothy-1-3	I thank God, whom I serve from <i>my</i> forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;	2-Timothy 1 : 3	Flowers_0001_295	bgc-0003
2-Timothy-1-4	Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;	2-Timothy 1 : 4	Flowers_0001_296	bgc-0004
2-Timothy-1-5	When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.	2-Timothy 1 : 5	Flowers_0001_297	bgc-0005
2-Timothy-1-6	Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.	2-Timothy 1 : 6	Flowers_0001_298	bgc-0006
2-Timothy-1-7	For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.	2-Timothy 1 : 7	Flowers_0001_299	bgc-0007
2-Timothy-1-8	Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;	2-Timothy 1 : 8	Flowers_0001_300	bgc-0008
2-Timothy-1-9	Who hath saved us, and called <i>us</i> with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,	2-Timothy 1 : 9	Flowers_0001_301	bgc-0009
2-Timothy-1-10	But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:	2-Timothy 1 : 10	Flowers_0001_302	bgc-0010
2-Timothy-1-11	Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.	2-Timothy 1 : 11	Flowers_0001_303	bgc-0011
2-Timothy-1-12	For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.	2-Timothy 1 : 12	Flowers_0001_304	bgc-0012
2-Timothy-1-13	Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.	2-Timothy 1 : 13	Flowers_0001_305	bgc-0013
2-Timothy-1-14	That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.	2-Timothy 1 : 14	Flowers_0001_306	bgc-0014
2-Timothy-1-15	This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.	2-Timothy 1 : 15	Flowers_0001_307	bgc-0015
2-Timothy-1-16	The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:	2-Timothy 1 : 16	Flowers_0001_308	bgc-0016
2-Timothy-1-17	But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found <i>me</i>.	2-Timothy 1 : 17	Flowers_0001_309	bgc-0003
2-Timothy-1-18	The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.	2-Timothy 1 : 18	Flowers_0001_310	bgc-0004
2-Timothy-2-1	Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.	2-Timothy 2 : 1	Flowers_0001_311	bgc-0005
2-Timothy-2-2	And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.	2-Timothy 2 : 2	Flowers_0001_312	bgc-0006
2-Timothy-2-3	Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.	2-Timothy 2 : 3	Flowers_0001_313	bgc-0007
2-Timothy-2-4	No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of <i>this</i> life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.	2-Timothy 2 : 4	Flowers_0001_314	bgc-0008
2-Timothy-2-5	And if a man also strive for masteries, <i>yet</i> is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.	2-Timothy 2 : 5	Flowers_0001_315	bgc-0009
2-Timothy-2-6	The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.	2-Timothy 2 : 6	Flowers_0001_316	bgc-0010
2-Timothy-2-7	Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.	2-Timothy 2 : 7	Flowers_0001_317	bgc-0011
2-Timothy-2-8	Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:	2-Timothy 2 : 8	Flowers_0001_318	bgc-0012
2-Timothy-2-9	Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, <i>even</i> unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.	2-Timothy 2 : 9	Flowers_0001_319	bgc-0013
2-Timothy-2-10	Therefore I endure all things for the electâ€™s sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.	2-Timothy 2 : 10	Flowers_0001_320	bgc-0014
2-Timothy-2-11	<i>It is</i> a faithful saying: For if we be dead with <i>him</i>, we shall also live with <i>him</i>:	2-Timothy 2 : 11	Flowers_0001_321	bgc-0015
2-Timothy-2-12	If we suffer, we shall also reign with <i>him</i>: if we deny <i>him</i>, he also will deny us:	2-Timothy 2 : 12	Flowers_0001_322	bgc-0016
2-Timothy-2-13	If we believe not, <i>yet</i> he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.	2-Timothy 2 : 13	Flowers_0001_323	bgc-0003
2-Timothy-2-14	Of these things put <i>them</i> in remembrance, charging <i>them</i> before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, <i>but</i> to the subverting of the hearers.	2-Timothy 2 : 14	Flowers_0001_324	bgc-0004
2-Timothy-2-15	Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.	2-Timothy 2 : 15	Flowers_0001_325	bgc-0005
2-Timothy-2-16	But shun profane <i>and</i> vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.	2-Timothy 2 : 16	Flowers_0001_326	bgc-0006
2-Timothy-2-17	And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;	2-Timothy 2 : 17	Flowers_0001_327	bgc-0007
2-Timothy-2-18	Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.	2-Timothy 2 : 18	Flowers_0001_328	bgc-0008
2-Timothy-2-19	Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.	2-Timothy 2 : 19	Flowers_0001_329	bgc-0009
2-Timothy-2-20	But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.	2-Timothy 2 : 20	Flowers_0001_330	bgc-0010
2-Timothy-2-21	If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the masterâ€™s use, <i>and</i> prepared unto every good work.	2-Timothy 2 : 21	Flowers_0001_331	bgc-0011
2-Timothy-2-22	Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.	2-Timothy 2 : 22	Flowers_0001_332	bgc-0012
2-Timothy-2-23	But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.	2-Timothy 2 : 23	Flowers_0001_333	bgc-0013
2-Timothy-2-24	And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all <i>men</i>, apt to teach, patient,	2-Timothy 2 : 24	Flowers_0001_334	bgc-0014
2-Timothy-2-25	In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;	2-Timothy 2 : 25	Flowers_0001_335	bgc-0015
2-Timothy-2-26	And <i>that</i> they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.	2-Timothy 2 : 26	Flowers_0001_336	bgc-0016
2-Timothy-3-1	This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.	2-Timothy 3 : 1	Flowers_0001_337	bgc-0003
2-Timothy-3-2	For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,	2-Timothy 3 : 2	Flowers_0001_338	bgc-0004
2-Timothy-3-3	Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,	2-Timothy 3 : 3	Flowers_0001_339	bgc-0005
2-Timothy-3-4	Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;	2-Timothy 3 : 4	Flowers_0001_340	bgc-0006
2-Timothy-3-5	Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.	2-Timothy 3 : 5	Flowers_0001_341	bgc-0007
2-Timothy-3-6	For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,	2-Timothy 3 : 6	Flowers_0001_342	bgc-0008
2-Timothy-3-7	Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.	2-Timothy 3 : 7	Flowers_0001_343	bgc-0009
2-Timothy-3-8	Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.	2-Timothy 3 : 8	Flowers_0001_1	bgc-0010
2-Timothy-3-9	But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all <i>men</i>, as theirs also was.	2-Timothy 3 : 9	Flowers_0001_2	bgc-0011
2-Timothy-3-10	But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,	2-Timothy 3 : 10	Flowers_0001_3	bgc-0012
2-Timothy-3-11	Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of <i>them</i> all the Lord delivered me.	2-Timothy 3 : 11	Flowers_0001_4	bgc-0013
2-Timothy-3-12	Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.	2-Timothy 3 : 12	Flowers_0001_5	bgc-0014
2-Timothy-3-13	But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.	2-Timothy 3 : 13	Flowers_0001_6	bgc-0015
2-Timothy-3-14	But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned <i>them</i>;	2-Timothy 3 : 14	Flowers_0001_7	bgc-0016
2-Timothy-3-15	And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.	2-Timothy 3 : 15	Flowers_0001_8	bgc-0003
2-Timothy-3-16	All scripture <i>is</i> given by inspiration of God, and <i>is</i> profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:	2-Timothy 3 : 16	Flowers_0001_9	bgc-0004
2-Timothy-3-17	That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.	2-Timothy 3 : 17	Flowers_0001_10	bgc-0005
2-Timothy-4-1	I charge <i>thee</i> therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;	2-Timothy 4 : 1	Flowers_0001_11	bgc-0006
2-Timothy-4-2	Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.	2-Timothy 4 : 2	Flowers_0001_12	bgc-0007
2-Timothy-4-3	For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;	2-Timothy 4 : 3	Flowers_0001_13	bgc-0008
2-Timothy-4-4	And they shall turn away <i>their</i> ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.	2-Timothy 4 : 4	Flowers_0001_14	bgc-0009
2-Timothy-4-5	But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.	2-Timothy 4 : 5	Flowers_0001_15	bgc-0010
2-Timothy-4-6	For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.	2-Timothy 4 : 6	Flowers_0001_16	bgc-0011
2-Timothy-4-7	I have fought a good fight, I have finished <i>my</i> course, I have kept the faith:	2-Timothy 4 : 7	Flowers_0001_17	bgc-0012
2-Timothy-4-8	Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.	2-Timothy 4 : 8	Flowers_0001_18	bgc-0013
2-Timothy-4-9	Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:	2-Timothy 4 : 9	Flowers_0001_19	bgc-0014
2-Timothy-4-10	For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.	2-Timothy 4 : 10	Flowers_0001_20	bgc-0015
2-Timothy-4-11	Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.	2-Timothy 4 : 11	Flowers_0001_21	bgc-0016
2-Timothy-4-12	And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.	2-Timothy 4 : 12	Flowers_0001_22	bgc-0003
2-Timothy-4-13	The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring <i>with thee</i>, and the books, <i>but</i> especially the parchments.	2-Timothy 4 : 13	Flowers_0001_23	bgc-0004
2-Timothy-4-14	Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:	2-Timothy 4 : 14	Flowers_0001_24	bgc-0005
2-Timothy-4-15	Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.	2-Timothy 4 : 15	Flowers_0001_25	bgc-0006
2-Timothy-4-16	At my first answer no man stood with me, but all <i>men</i> forsook me: <i>I pray God</i> that it may not be laid to their charge.	2-Timothy 4 : 16	Flowers_0001_26	bgc-0007
2-Timothy-4-17	Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and <i>that</i> all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.	2-Timothy 4 : 17	Flowers_0001_27	bgc-0008
2-Timothy-4-18	And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve <i>me</i> unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom <i>be</i> glory for ever and ever. Amen.	2-Timothy 4 : 18	Flowers_0001_28	bgc-0009
2-Timothy-4-19	Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.	2-Timothy 4 : 19	Flowers_0001_29	bgc-0010
2-Timothy-4-20	Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.	2-Timothy 4 : 20	Flowers_0001_30	bgc-0011
2-Timothy-4-21	Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.	2-Timothy 4 : 21	Flowers_0001_31	bgc-0012
2-Timothy-4-22	The Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with thy spirit. Grace <i>be</i> with you. Amen. 	2-Timothy 4 : 22	Flowers_0001_32	bgc-0013
Titus-1-1	Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of Godâ€™s elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;	Titus 1 : 1	Flowers_0001_33	bgc-0014
Titus-1-2	In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;	Titus 1 : 2	Flowers_0001_34	bgc-0015
Titus-1-3	But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;	Titus 1 : 3	Flowers_0001_35	bgc-0016
Titus-1-4	To Titus, <i>mine</i> own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, <i>and</i> peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.	Titus 1 : 4	Flowers_0001_36	bgc-0003
Titus-1-5	For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:	Titus 1 : 5	Flowers_0001_37	bgc-0004
Titus-1-6	If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.	Titus 1 : 6	Flowers_0001_38	bgc-0005
Titus-1-7	For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;	Titus 1 : 7	Flowers_0001_39	bgc-0006
Titus-1-8	But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;	Titus 1 : 8	Flowers_0001_40	bgc-0007
Titus-1-9	Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.	Titus 1 : 9	Flowers_0001_41	bgc-0008
Titus-1-10	For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:	Titus 1 : 10	Flowers_0001_42	bgc-0009
Titus-1-11	Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucreâ€™s sake.	Titus 1 : 11	Flowers_0001_43	bgc-0010
Titus-1-12	One of themselves, <i>even</i> a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians <i>are</i> alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.	Titus 1 : 12	Flowers_0001_44	bgc-0011
Titus-1-13	This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;	Titus 1 : 13	Flowers_0001_45	bgc-0012
Titus-1-14	Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.	Titus 1 : 14	Flowers_0001_46	bgc-0013
Titus-1-15	Unto the pure all things <i>are</i> pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving <i>is</i> nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.	Titus 1 : 15	Flowers_0001_47	bgc-0014
Titus-1-16	They profess that they know God; but in works they deny <i>him</i>, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.	Titus 1 : 16	Flowers_0001_48	bgc-0015
Titus-2-1	But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:	Titus 2 : 1	Flowers_0001_49	bgc-0016
Titus-2-2	That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.	Titus 2 : 2	Flowers_0001_50	bgc-0003
Titus-2-3	The aged women likewise, that <i>they be</i> in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;	Titus 2 : 3	Flowers_0001_51	bgc-0004
Titus-2-4	That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,	Titus 2 : 4	Flowers_0001_52	bgc-0005
Titus-2-5	<i>To be</i> discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.	Titus 2 : 5	Flowers_0001_53	bgc-0006
Titus-2-6	Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.	Titus 2 : 6	Flowers_0001_54	bgc-0007
Titus-2-7	In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine <i>shewing</i> uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,	Titus 2 : 7	Flowers_0001_55	bgc-0008
Titus-2-8	Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.	Titus 2 : 8	Flowers_0001_56	bgc-0009
Titus-2-9	<i>Exhort</i> servants to be obedient unto their own masters, <i>and</i> to please <i>them</i> well in all <i>things</i>; not answering again;	Titus 2 : 9	Flowers_0001_57	bgc-0010
Titus-2-10	Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.	Titus 2 : 10	Flowers_0001_58	bgc-0011
Titus-2-11	For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,	Titus 2 : 11	Flowers_0001_59	bgc-0012
Titus-2-12	Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;	Titus 2 : 12	Flowers_0001_60	bgc-0013
Titus-2-13	Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;	Titus 2 : 13	Flowers_0001_61	bgc-0014
Titus-2-14	Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.	Titus 2 : 14	Flowers_0001_62	bgc-0015
Titus-2-15	These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.	Titus 2 : 15	Flowers_0001_63	bgc-0016
Titus-3-1	Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,	Titus 3 : 1	Flowers_0001_64	bgc-0003
Titus-3-2	To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, <i>but</i> gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.	Titus 3 : 2	Flowers_0001_65	bgc-0004
Titus-3-3	For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, <i>and</i> hating one another.	Titus 3 : 3	Flowers_0001_66	bgc-0005
Titus-3-4	But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,	Titus 3 : 4	Flowers_0001_67	bgc-0006
Titus-3-5	Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;	Titus 3 : 5	Flowers_0001_68	bgc-0007
Titus-3-6	Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;	Titus 3 : 6	Flowers_0001_69	bgc-0008
Titus-3-7	That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.	Titus 3 : 7	Flowers_0001_70	bgc-0009
Titus-3-8	<i>This is</i> a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.	Titus 3 : 8	Flowers_0001_71	bgc-0010
Titus-3-9	But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.	Titus 3 : 9	Flowers_0001_72	bgc-0011
Titus-3-10	A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;	Titus 3 : 10	Flowers_0001_73	bgc-0012
Titus-3-11	Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.	Titus 3 : 11	Flowers_0001_74	bgc-0013
Titus-3-12	When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.	Titus 3 : 12	Flowers_0001_75	bgc-0014
Titus-3-13	Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.	Titus 3 : 13	Flowers_0001_76	bgc-0015
Titus-3-14	And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.	Titus 3 : 14	Flowers_0001_77	bgc-0016
Titus-3-15	All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace <i>be</i> with you all. Amen. 	Titus 3 : 15	Flowers_0001_78	bgc-0003
Philemon-1-1	Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy <i>our</i> brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,	Philemon 1 : 1	Flowers_0001_79	bgc-0004
Philemon-1-2	And to <i>our</i> beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:	Philemon 1 : 2	Flowers_0001_80	bgc-0005
Philemon-1-3	Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.	Philemon 1 : 3	Flowers_0001_81	bgc-0006
Philemon-1-4	I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,	Philemon 1 : 4	Flowers_0001_82	bgc-0007
Philemon-1-5	Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;	Philemon 1 : 5	Flowers_0001_83	bgc-0008
Philemon-1-6	That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.	Philemon 1 : 6	Flowers_0001_84	bgc-0009
Philemon-1-7	For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.	Philemon 1 : 7	Flowers_0001_85	bgc-0010
Philemon-1-8	Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,	Philemon 1 : 8	Flowers_0001_86	bgc-0011
Philemon-1-9	Yet for loveâ€™s sake I rather beseech <i>thee</i>, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.	Philemon 1 : 9	Flowers_0001_87	bgc-0012
Philemon-1-10	I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:	Philemon 1 : 10	Flowers_0001_88	bgc-0013
Philemon-1-11	Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:	Philemon 1 : 11	Flowers_0001_89	bgc-0014
Philemon-1-12	Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:	Philemon 1 : 12	Flowers_0001_90	bgc-0015
Philemon-1-13	Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:	Philemon 1 : 13	Flowers_0001_91	bgc-0016
Philemon-1-14	But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.	Philemon 1 : 14	Flowers_0001_92	bgc-0003
Philemon-1-15	For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;	Philemon 1 : 15	Flowers_0001_93	bgc-0004
Philemon-1-16	Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?	Philemon 1 : 16	Flowers_0001_94	bgc-0005
Philemon-1-17	If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.	Philemon 1 : 17	Flowers_0001_95	bgc-0006
Philemon-1-18	If he hath wronged thee, or oweth <i>thee</i> ought, put that on mine account;	Philemon 1 : 18	Flowers_0001_96	bgc-0007
Philemon-1-19	I Paul have written <i>it</i> with mine own hand, I will repay <i>it</i>: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.	Philemon 1 : 19	Flowers_0001_97	bgc-0008
Philemon-1-20	Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.	Philemon 1 : 20	Flowers_0001_98	bgc-0009
Philemon-1-21	Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.	Philemon 1 : 21	Flowers_0001_99	bgc-0010
Philemon-1-22	But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.	Philemon 1 : 22	Flowers_0001_100	bgc-0011
Philemon-1-23	There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;	Philemon 1 : 23	Flowers_0001_101	bgc-0012
Philemon-1-24	Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.	Philemon 1 : 24	Flowers_0001_102	bgc-0013
Philemon-1-25	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ <i>be</i> with your spirit. Amen. 	Philemon 1 : 25	Flowers_0001_103	bgc-0014
Hebrews-1-1	God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,	Hebrews 1 : 1	Flowers_0001_104	bgc-0015
Hebrews-1-2	Hath in these last days spoken unto us by <i>his</i> Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;	Hebrews 1 : 2	Flowers_0001_105	bgc-0016
Hebrews-1-3	Who being the brightness of <i>his</i> glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;	Hebrews 1 : 3	Flowers_0001_106	bgc-0003
Hebrews-1-4	Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.	Hebrews 1 : 4	Flowers_0001_107	bgc-0004
Hebrews-1-5	For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?	Hebrews 1 : 5	Flowers_0001_108	bgc-0005
Hebrews-1-6	And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.	Hebrews 1 : 6	Flowers_0001_109	bgc-0006
Hebrews-1-7	And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.	Hebrews 1 : 7	Flowers_0001_110	bgc-0007
Hebrews-1-8	But unto the Son <i>he saith</i>, Thy throne, O God, <i>is</i> for ever and ever: a sceptre of righteousness <i>is</i> the sceptre of thy kingdom.	Hebrews 1 : 8	Flowers_0001_111	bgc-0008
Hebrews-1-9	Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, <i>even</i> thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.	Hebrews 1 : 9	Flowers_0001_112	bgc-0009
Hebrews-1-10	And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:	Hebrews 1 : 10	Flowers_0001_113	bgc-0010
Hebrews-1-11	They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;	Hebrews 1 : 11	Flowers_0001_114	bgc-0011
Hebrews-1-12	And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.	Hebrews 1 : 12	Flowers_0001_115	bgc-0012
Hebrews-1-13	But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?	Hebrews 1 : 13	Flowers_0001_116	bgc-0013
Hebrews-1-14	Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?	Hebrews 1 : 14	Flowers_0001_117	bgc-0014
Hebrews-2-1	Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let <i>them</i> slip.	Hebrews 2 : 1	Flowers_0001_118	bgc-0015
Hebrews-2-2	For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of reward;	Hebrews 2 : 2	Flowers_0001_119	bgc-0016
Hebrews-2-3	How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard <i>him</i>;	Hebrews 2 : 3	Flowers_0001_120	bgc-0003
Hebrews-2-4	God also bearing <i>them</i> witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?	Hebrews 2 : 4	Flowers_0001_121	bgc-0004
Hebrews-2-5	For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to come, whereof we speak.	Hebrews 2 : 5	Flowers_0001_122	bgc-0005
Hebrews-2-6	But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou visitest him?	Hebrews 2 : 6	Flowers_0001_123	bgc-0006
Hebrews-2-7	Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of thy hands:	Hebrews 2 : 7	Flowers_0001_124	bgc-0007
Hebrews-2-8	Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing <i>that is</i> not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put under him.	Hebrews 2 : 8	Flowers_0001_125	bgc-0008
Hebrews-2-9	But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.	Hebrews 2 : 9	Flowers_0001_126	bgc-0009
Hebrews-2-10	For it became him, for whom <i>are</i> all things, and by whom <i>are</i> all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.	Hebrews 2 : 10	Flowers_0001_127	bgc-0010
Hebrews-2-11	For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified <i>are</i> all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,	Hebrews 2 : 11	Flowers_0001_128	bgc-0011
Hebrews-2-12	Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of the church will I sing praise unto thee.	Hebrews 2 : 12	Flowers_0001_129	bgc-0012
Hebrews-2-13	And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God hath given me.	Hebrews 2 : 13	Flowers_0001_130	bgc-0013
Hebrews-2-14	Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;	Hebrews 2 : 14	Flowers_0001_131	bgc-0014
Hebrews-2-15	And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.	Hebrews 2 : 15	Flowers_0001_132	bgc-0015
Hebrews-2-16	For verily he took not on <i>him the nature of</i> angels; but he took on <i>him</i> the seed of Abraham.	Hebrews 2 : 16	Flowers_0001_133	bgc-0016
Hebrews-2-17	Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto <i>his</i> brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things <i>pertaining</i> to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.	Hebrews 2 : 17	Flowers_0001_134	bgc-0003
Hebrews-2-18	For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.	Hebrews 2 : 18	Flowers_0001_135	bgc-0004
Hebrews-3-1	Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;	Hebrews 3 : 1	Flowers_0001_136	bgc-0005
Hebrews-3-2	Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses <i>was faithful</i> in all his house.	Hebrews 3 : 2	Flowers_0001_137	bgc-0006
Hebrews-3-3	For this <i>man</i> was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.	Hebrews 3 : 3	Flowers_0001_138	bgc-0007
Hebrews-3-4	For every house is builded by some <i>man</i>; but he that built all things <i>is</i> God.	Hebrews 3 : 4	Flowers_0001_139	bgc-0008
Hebrews-3-5	And Moses verily <i>was</i> faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;	Hebrews 3 : 5	Flowers_0001_140	bgc-0009
Hebrews-3-6	But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.	Hebrews 3 : 6	Flowers_0001_141	bgc-0010
Hebrews-3-7	Wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,	Hebrews 3 : 7	Flowers_0001_142	bgc-0011
Hebrews-3-8	Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:	Hebrews 3 : 8	Flowers_0001_143	bgc-0012
Hebrews-3-9	When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.	Hebrews 3 : 9	Flowers_0001_144	bgc-0013
Hebrews-3-10	Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in <i>their</i> heart; and they have not known my ways.	Hebrews 3 : 10	Flowers_0001_145	bgc-0014
Hebrews-3-11	So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.	Hebrews 3 : 11	Flowers_0001_146	bgc-0015
Hebrews-3-12	Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.	Hebrews 3 : 12	Flowers_0001_147	bgc-0016
Hebrews-3-13	But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.	Hebrews 3 : 13	Flowers_0001_148	bgc-0003
Hebrews-3-14	For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;	Hebrews 3 : 14	Flowers_0001_149	bgc-0004
Hebrews-3-15	While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.	Hebrews 3 : 15	Flowers_0001_150	bgc-0005
Hebrews-3-16	For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.	Hebrews 3 : 16	Flowers_0001_151	bgc-0006
Hebrews-3-17	But with whom was he grieved forty years? <i>was it</i> not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?	Hebrews 3 : 17	Flowers_0001_152	bgc-0007
Hebrews-3-18	And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?	Hebrews 3 : 18	Flowers_0001_153	bgc-0008
Hebrews-3-19	So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.	Hebrews 3 : 19	Flowers_0001_154	bgc-0009
Hebrews-4-1	Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left <i>us</i> of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.	Hebrews 4 : 1	Flowers_0001_155	bgc-0010
Hebrews-4-2	For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard <i>it</i>.	Hebrews 4 : 2	Flowers_0001_156	bgc-0011
Hebrews-4-3	For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.	Hebrews 4 : 3	Flowers_0001_157	bgc-0012
Hebrews-4-4	For he spake in a certain place of the seventh <i>day</i> on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.	Hebrews 4 : 4	Flowers_0001_158	bgc-0013
Hebrews-4-5	And in this <i>place</i> again, If they shall enter into my rest.	Hebrews 4 : 5	Flowers_0001_159	bgc-0014
Hebrews-4-6	Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:	Hebrews 4 : 6	Flowers_0001_160	bgc-0015
Hebrews-4-7	Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.	Hebrews 4 : 7	Flowers_0001_161	bgc-0016
Hebrews-4-8	For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.	Hebrews 4 : 8	Flowers_0001_162	bgc-0003
Hebrews-4-9	There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.	Hebrews 4 : 9	Flowers_0001_163	bgc-0004
Hebrews-4-10	For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God <i>did</i> from his.	Hebrews 4 : 10	Flowers_0001_164	bgc-0005
Hebrews-4-11	Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.	Hebrews 4 : 11	Flowers_0001_165	bgc-0006
Hebrews-4-12	For the word of God <i>is</i> quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and <i>is</i> a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.	Hebrews 4 : 12	Flowers_0001_166	bgc-0007
Hebrews-4-13	Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things <i>are</i> naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.	Hebrews 4 : 13	Flowers_0001_167	bgc-0008
Hebrews-4-14	Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast <i>our</i> profession.	Hebrews 4 : 14	Flowers_0001_168	bgc-0009
Hebrews-4-15	For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as <i>we are, yet</i> without sin.	Hebrews 4 : 15	Flowers_0001_169	bgc-0010
Hebrews-4-16	Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.	Hebrews 4 : 16	Flowers_0001_170	bgc-0011
Hebrews-5-1	For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men in things <i>pertaining</i> to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:	Hebrews 5 : 1	Flowers_0001_171	bgc-0012
Hebrews-5-2	Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity.	Hebrews 5 : 2	Flowers_0001_172	bgc-0013
Hebrews-5-3	And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.	Hebrews 5 : 3	Flowers_0001_173	bgc-0014
Hebrews-5-4	And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as <i>was</i> Aaron.	Hebrews 5 : 4	Flowers_0001_174	bgc-0015
Hebrews-5-5	So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.	Hebrews 5 : 5	Flowers_0001_175	bgc-0016
Hebrews-5-6	As he saith also in another <i>place</i>, Thou <i>art</i> a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.	Hebrews 5 : 6	Flowers_0001_176	bgc-0003
Hebrews-5-7	Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he feared;	Hebrews 5 : 7	Flowers_0001_177	bgc-0004
Hebrews-5-8	Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered;	Hebrews 5 : 8	Flowers_0001_178	bgc-0005
Hebrews-5-9	And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him;	Hebrews 5 : 9	Flowers_0001_179	bgc-0006
Hebrews-5-10	Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.	Hebrews 5 : 10	Flowers_0001_180	bgc-0007
Hebrews-5-11	Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing.	Hebrews 5 : 11	Flowers_0001_181	bgc-0008
Hebrews-5-12	For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need that one teach you again which <i>be</i> the first principles of the oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.	Hebrews 5 : 12	Flowers_0001_182	bgc-0009
Hebrews-5-13	For every one that useth milk <i>is</i> unskilful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe.	Hebrews 5 : 13	Flowers_0001_183	bgc-0010
Hebrews-5-14	But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, <i>even</i> those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.	Hebrews 5 : 14	Flowers_0001_184	bgc-0011
Hebrews-6-1	Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,	Hebrews 6 : 1	Flowers_0001_185	bgc-0012
Hebrews-6-2	Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.	Hebrews 6 : 2	Flowers_0001_186	bgc-0013
Hebrews-6-3	And this will we do, if God permit.	Hebrews 6 : 3	Flowers_0001_187	bgc-0014
Hebrews-6-4	For <i>it is</i> impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,	Hebrews 6 : 4	Flowers_0001_188	bgc-0015
Hebrews-6-5	And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,	Hebrews 6 : 5	Flowers_0001_189	bgc-0016
Hebrews-6-6	If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put <i>him</i> to an open shame.	Hebrews 6 : 6	Flowers_0001_190	bgc-0003
Hebrews-6-7	For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:	Hebrews 6 : 7	Flowers_0001_191	bgc-0004
Hebrews-6-8	But that which beareth thorns and briers <i>is</i> rejected, and <i>is</i> nigh unto cursing; whose end <i>is</i> to be burned.	Hebrews 6 : 8	Flowers_0001_192	bgc-0005
Hebrews-6-9	But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.	Hebrews 6 : 9	Flowers_0001_193	bgc-0006
Hebrews-6-10	For God <i>is</i> not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.	Hebrews 6 : 10	Flowers_0001_194	bgc-0007
Hebrews-6-11	And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:	Hebrews 6 : 11	Flowers_0001_195	bgc-0008
Hebrews-6-12	That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.	Hebrews 6 : 12	Flowers_0001_196	bgc-0009
Hebrews-6-13	For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,	Hebrews 6 : 13	Flowers_0001_197	bgc-0010
Hebrews-6-14	Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.	Hebrews 6 : 14	Flowers_0001_198	bgc-0011
Hebrews-6-15	And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.	Hebrews 6 : 15	Flowers_0001_199	bgc-0012
Hebrews-6-16	For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation <i>is</i> to them an end of all strife.	Hebrews 6 : 16	Flowers_0001_200	bgc-0013
Hebrews-6-17	Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed <i>it</i> by an oath:	Hebrews 6 : 17	Flowers_0001_201	bgc-0014
Hebrews-6-18	That by two immutable things, in which <i>it was</i> impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:	Hebrews 6 : 18	Flowers_0001_202	bgc-0015
Hebrews-6-19	Which <i>hope</i> we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;	Hebrews 6 : 19	Flowers_0001_203	bgc-0016
Hebrews-6-20	Whither the forerunner is for us entered, <i>even</i> Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.	Hebrews 6 : 20	Flowers_0001_204	bgc-0003
Hebrews-7-1	For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;	Hebrews 7 : 1	Flowers_0001_205	bgc-0004
Hebrews-7-2	To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;	Hebrews 7 : 2	Flowers_0001_206	bgc-0005
Hebrews-7-3	Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.	Hebrews 7 : 3	Flowers_0001_207	bgc-0006
Hebrews-7-4	Now consider how great this man <i>was</i>, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.	Hebrews 7 : 4	Flowers_0001_208	bgc-0007
Hebrews-7-5	And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:	Hebrews 7 : 5	Flowers_0001_209	bgc-0008
Hebrews-7-6	But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.	Hebrews 7 : 6	Flowers_0001_210	bgc-0009
Hebrews-7-7	And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.	Hebrews 7 : 7	Flowers_0001_211	bgc-0010
Hebrews-7-8	And here men that die receive tithes; but there he <i>receiveth them</i>, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.	Hebrews 7 : 8	Flowers_0001_212	bgc-0011
Hebrews-7-9	And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.	Hebrews 7 : 9	Flowers_0001_213	bgc-0012
Hebrews-7-10	For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.	Hebrews 7 : 10	Flowers_0001_214	bgc-0013
Hebrews-7-11	If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need <i>was there</i> that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?	Hebrews 7 : 11	Flowers_0001_215	bgc-0014
Hebrews-7-12	For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.	Hebrews 7 : 12	Flowers_0001_216	bgc-0015
Hebrews-7-13	For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.	Hebrews 7 : 13	Flowers_0001_217	bgc-0016
Hebrews-7-14	For <i>it is</i> evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.	Hebrews 7 : 14	Flowers_0001_218	bgc-0003
Hebrews-7-15	And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,	Hebrews 7 : 15	Flowers_0001_219	bgc-0004
Hebrews-7-16	Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.	Hebrews 7 : 16	Flowers_0001_220	bgc-0005
Hebrews-7-17	For he testifieth, Thou <i>art</i> a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.	Hebrews 7 : 17	Flowers_0001_221	bgc-0006
Hebrews-7-18	For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.	Hebrews 7 : 18	Flowers_0001_222	bgc-0007
Hebrews-7-19	For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope <i>did</i>; by the which we draw nigh unto God.	Hebrews 7 : 19	Flowers_0001_223	bgc-0008
Hebrews-7-20	And inasmuch as not without an oath <i>he was made priest</i>:	Hebrews 7 : 20	Flowers_0001_224	bgc-0009
Hebrews-7-21	(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou <i>art</i> a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)	Hebrews 7 : 21	Flowers_0001_225	bgc-0010
Hebrews-7-22	By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.	Hebrews 7 : 22	Flowers_0001_226	bgc-0011
Hebrews-7-23	And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:	Hebrews 7 : 23	Flowers_0001_227	bgc-0012
Hebrews-7-24	But this <i>man</i>, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.	Hebrews 7 : 24	Flowers_0001_228	bgc-0013
Hebrews-7-25	Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.	Hebrews 7 : 25	Flowers_0001_229	bgc-0014
Hebrews-7-26	For such an high priest became us, <i>who is</i> holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;	Hebrews 7 : 26	Flowers_0001_230	bgc-0015
Hebrews-7-27	Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the peopleâ€™s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.	Hebrews 7 : 27	Flowers_0001_231	bgc-0016
Hebrews-7-28	For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, <i>maketh</i> the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.	Hebrews 7 : 28	Flowers_0001_232	bgc-0003
Hebrews-8-1	Now of the things which we have spoken <i>this is</i> the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;	Hebrews 8 : 1	Flowers_0001_233	bgc-0004
Hebrews-8-2	A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.	Hebrews 8 : 2	Flowers_0001_234	bgc-0005
Hebrews-8-3	For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore <i>it is</i> of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.	Hebrews 8 : 3	Flowers_0001_235	bgc-0006
Hebrews-8-4	For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:	Hebrews 8 : 4	Flowers_0001_236	bgc-0007
Hebrews-8-5	Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, <i>that</i> thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.	Hebrews 8 : 5	Flowers_0001_237	bgc-0008
Hebrews-8-6	But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.	Hebrews 8 : 6	Flowers_0001_238	bgc-0009
Hebrews-8-7	For if that first <i>covenant</i> had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.	Hebrews 8 : 7	Flowers_0001_239	bgc-0010
Hebrews-8-8	For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:	Hebrews 8 : 8	Flowers_0001_240	bgc-0011
Hebrews-8-9	Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.	Hebrews 8 : 9	Flowers_0001_241	bgc-0012
Hebrews-8-10	For this <i>is</i> the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:	Hebrews 8 : 10	Flowers_0001_242	bgc-0013
Hebrews-8-11	And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.	Hebrews 8 : 11	Flowers_0001_243	bgc-0014
Hebrews-8-12	For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.	Hebrews 8 : 12	Flowers_0001_244	bgc-0015
Hebrews-8-13	In that he saith, A new <i>covenant</i>, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old <i>is</i> ready to vanish away.	Hebrews 8 : 13	Flowers_0001_245	bgc-0016
Hebrews-9-1	Then verily the first <i>covenant</i> had also ordinances of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.	Hebrews 9 : 1	Flowers_0001_246	bgc-0003
Hebrews-9-2	For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein <i>was</i> the candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the sanctuary.	Hebrews 9 : 2	Flowers_0001_247	bgc-0004
Hebrews-9-3	And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the Holiest of all;	Hebrews 9 : 3	Flowers_0001_248	bgc-0005
Hebrews-9-4	Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, wherein <i>was</i> the golden pot that had manna, and Aaronâ€™s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;	Hebrews 9 : 4	Flowers_0001_249	bgc-0006
Hebrews-9-5	And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of which we cannot now speak particularly.	Hebrews 9 : 5	Flowers_0001_250	bgc-0007
Hebrews-9-6	Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service <i>of God</i>.	Hebrews 9 : 6	Flowers_0001_251	bgc-0008
Hebrews-9-7	But into the second <i>went</i> the high priest alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and <i>for</i> the errors of the people:	Hebrews 9 : 7	Flowers_0001_252	bgc-0009
Hebrews-9-8	The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet standing:	Hebrews 9 : 8	Flowers_0001_253	bgc-0010
Hebrews-9-9	Which <i>was</i> a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;	Hebrews 9 : 9	Flowers_0001_254	bgc-0011
Hebrews-9-10	<i>Which stood</i> only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed <i>on them</i> until the time of reformation.	Hebrews 9 : 10	Flowers_0001_255	bgc-0012
Hebrews-9-11	But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this building;	Hebrews 9 : 11	Flowers_0001_256	bgc-0013
Hebrews-9-12	Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption <i>for us</i>.	Hebrews 9 : 12	Flowers_0001_257	bgc-0014
Hebrews-9-13	For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh:	Hebrews 9 : 13	Flowers_0001_258	bgc-0015
Hebrews-9-14	How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?	Hebrews 9 : 14	Flowers_0001_259	bgc-0016
Hebrews-9-15	And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions <i>that were</i> under the first testament, they which are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.	Hebrews 9 : 15	Flowers_0001_260	bgc-0003
Hebrews-9-16	For where a testament <i>is</i>, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.	Hebrews 9 : 16	Flowers_0001_261	bgc-0004
Hebrews-9-17	For a testament <i>is</i> of force after men are dead: otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.	Hebrews 9 : 17	Flowers_0001_262	bgc-0005
Hebrews-9-18	Whereupon neither the first <i>testament</i> was dedicated without blood.	Hebrews 9 : 18	Flowers_0001_263	bgc-0006
Hebrews-9-19	For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and all the people,	Hebrews 9 : 19	Flowers_0001_264	bgc-0007
Hebrews-9-20	Saying, This <i>is</i> the blood of the testament which God hath enjoined unto you.	Hebrews 9 : 20	Flowers_0001_265	bgc-0008
Hebrews-9-21	Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.	Hebrews 9 : 21	Flowers_0001_266	bgc-0009
Hebrews-9-22	And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and without shedding of blood is no remission.	Hebrews 9 : 22	Flowers_0001_267	bgc-0010
Hebrews-9-23	<i>It was</i> therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.	Hebrews 9 : 23	Flowers_0001_268	bgc-0011
Hebrews-9-24	For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands, <i>which are</i> the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:	Hebrews 9 : 24	Flowers_0001_269	bgc-0012
Hebrews-9-25	Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;	Hebrews 9 : 25	Flowers_0001_270	bgc-0013
Hebrews-9-26	For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.	Hebrews 9 : 26	Flowers_0001_271	bgc-0014
Hebrews-9-27	And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:	Hebrews 9 : 27	Flowers_0001_272	bgc-0015
Hebrews-9-28	So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation.	Hebrews 9 : 28	Flowers_0001_273	bgc-0016
Hebrews-10-1	For the law having a shadow of good things to come, <i>and</i> not the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect.	Hebrews 10 : 1	Flowers_0001_274	bgc-0003
Hebrews-10-2	For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.	Hebrews 10 : 2	Flowers_0001_275	bgc-0004
Hebrews-10-3	But in those <i>sacrifices there is</i> a remembrance again <i>made</i> of sins every year.	Hebrews 10 : 3	Flowers_0001_276	bgc-0005
Hebrews-10-4	For <i>it is</i> not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.	Hebrews 10 : 4	Flowers_0001_277	bgc-0006
Hebrews-10-5	Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared me:	Hebrews 10 : 5	Flowers_0001_278	bgc-0007
Hebrews-10-6	In burnt offerings and <i>sacrifices</i> for sin thou hast had no pleasure.	Hebrews 10 : 6	Flowers_0001_279	bgc-0008
Hebrews-10-7	Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do thy will, O God.	Hebrews 10 : 7	Flowers_0001_280	bgc-0009
Hebrews-10-8	Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and <i>offering</i> for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure <i>therein</i>; which are offered by the law;	Hebrews 10 : 8	Flowers_0001_281	bgc-0010
Hebrews-10-9	Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first, that he may establish the second.	Hebrews 10 : 9	Flowers_0001_282	bgc-0011
Hebrews-10-10	By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once <i>for all</i>.	Hebrews 10 : 10	Flowers_0001_283	bgc-0012
Hebrews-10-11	And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:	Hebrews 10 : 11	Flowers_0001_284	bgc-0013
Hebrews-10-12	But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God;	Hebrews 10 : 12	Flowers_0001_285	bgc-0014
Hebrews-10-13	From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.	Hebrews 10 : 13	Flowers_0001_286	bgc-0015
Hebrews-10-14	For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.	Hebrews 10 : 14	Flowers_0001_287	bgc-0016
Hebrews-10-15	<i>Whereof</i> the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that he had said before,	Hebrews 10 : 15	Flowers_0001_288	bgc-0003
Hebrews-10-16	This <i>is</i> the covenant that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them;	Hebrews 10 : 16	Flowers_0001_289	bgc-0004
Hebrews-10-17	And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.	Hebrews 10 : 17	Flowers_0001_290	bgc-0005
Hebrews-10-18	Now where remission of these <i>is, there is</i> no more offering for sin.	Hebrews 10 : 18	Flowers_0001_291	bgc-0006
Hebrews-10-19	Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,	Hebrews 10 : 19	Flowers_0001_292	bgc-0007
Hebrews-10-20	By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;	Hebrews 10 : 20	Flowers_0001_293	bgc-0008
Hebrews-10-21	And <i>having</i> an high priest over the house of God;	Hebrews 10 : 21	Flowers_0001_294	bgc-0009
Hebrews-10-22	Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.	Hebrews 10 : 22	Flowers_0001_295	bgc-0010
Hebrews-10-23	Let us hold fast the profession of <i>our</i> faith without wavering; (for he <i>is</i> faithful that promised;)	Hebrews 10 : 23	Flowers_0001_296	bgc-0011
Hebrews-10-24	And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works:	Hebrews 10 : 24	Flowers_0001_297	bgc-0012
Hebrews-10-25	Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some <i>is</i>; but exhorting <i>one another</i>: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.	Hebrews 10 : 25	Flowers_0001_298	bgc-0013
Hebrews-10-26	For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,	Hebrews 10 : 26	Flowers_0001_299	bgc-0014
Hebrews-10-27	But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.	Hebrews 10 : 27	Flowers_0001_300	bgc-0015
Hebrews-10-28	He that despised Mosesâ€™ law died without mercy under two or three witnesses:	Hebrews 10 : 28	Flowers_0001_301	bgc-0016
Hebrews-10-29	Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of grace?	Hebrews 10 : 29	Flowers_0001_302	bgc-0003
Hebrews-10-30	For we know him that hath said, Vengeance <i>belongeth</i> unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.	Hebrews 10 : 30	Flowers_0001_303	bgc-0004
Hebrews-10-31	<i>It is</i> a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.	Hebrews 10 : 31	Flowers_0001_304	bgc-0005
Hebrews-10-32	But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;	Hebrews 10 : 32	Flowers_0001_305	bgc-0006
Hebrews-10-33	Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of them that were so used.	Hebrews 10 : 33	Flowers_0001_306	bgc-0007
Hebrews-10-34	For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance.	Hebrews 10 : 34	Flowers_0001_307	bgc-0008
Hebrews-10-35	Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great recompence of reward.	Hebrews 10 : 35	Flowers_0001_308	bgc-0009
Hebrews-10-36	For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.	Hebrews 10 : 36	Flowers_0001_309	bgc-0010
Hebrews-10-37	For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.	Hebrews 10 : 37	Flowers_0001_310	bgc-0011
Hebrews-10-38	Now the just shall live by faith: but if <i>any man</i> draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.	Hebrews 10 : 38	Flowers_0001_311	bgc-0012
Hebrews-10-39	But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of them that believe to the saving of the soul.	Hebrews 10 : 39	Flowers_0001_312	bgc-0013
Hebrews-11-1	Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.	Hebrews 11 : 1	Flowers_0001_313	bgc-0014
Hebrews-11-2	For by it the elders obtained a good report.	Hebrews 11 : 2	Flowers_0001_314	bgc-0015
Hebrews-11-3	Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear.	Hebrews 11 : 3	Flowers_0001_315	bgc-0016
Hebrews-11-4	By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.	Hebrews 11 : 4	Flowers_0001_316	bgc-0003
Hebrews-11-5	By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him: for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.	Hebrews 11 : 5	Flowers_0001_317	bgc-0004
Hebrews-11-6	But without faith <i>it is</i> impossible to please <i>him</i>: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and <i>that</i> he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.	Hebrews 11 : 6	Flowers_0001_318	bgc-0005
Hebrews-11-7	By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.	Hebrews 11 : 7	Flowers_0001_319	bgc-0006
Hebrews-11-8	By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went.	Hebrews 11 : 8	Flowers_0001_320	bgc-0007
Hebrews-11-9	By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as <i>in</i> a strange country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise:	Hebrews 11 : 9	Flowers_0001_321	bgc-0008
Hebrews-11-10	For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker <i>is</i> God.	Hebrews 11 : 10	Flowers_0001_322	bgc-0009
Hebrews-11-11	Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she judged him faithful who had promised.	Hebrews 11 : 11	Flowers_0001_323	bgc-0010
Hebrews-11-12	Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead, <i>so many</i> as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.	Hebrews 11 : 12	Flowers_0001_324	bgc-0011
Hebrews-11-13	These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of <i>them</i>, and embraced <i>them</i>, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.	Hebrews 11 : 13	Flowers_0001_325	bgc-0012
Hebrews-11-14	For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country.	Hebrews 11 : 14	Flowers_0001_326	bgc-0013
Hebrews-11-15	And truly, if they had been mindful of that <i>country</i> from whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have returned.	Hebrews 11 : 15	Flowers_0001_327	bgc-0014
Hebrews-11-16	But now they desire a better <i>country</i>, that is, an heavenly: wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he hath prepared for them a city.	Hebrews 11 : 16	Flowers_0001_328	bgc-0015
Hebrews-11-17	By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten <i>son</i>,	Hebrews 11 : 17	Flowers_0001_329	bgc-0016
Hebrews-11-18	Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:	Hebrews 11 : 18	Flowers_0001_330	bgc-0003
Hebrews-11-19	Accounting that God <i>was</i> able to raise <i>him</i> up, even from the dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.	Hebrews 11 : 19	Flowers_0001_331	bgc-0004
Hebrews-11-20	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.	Hebrews 11 : 20	Flowers_0001_332	bgc-0005

Hebrews-11-23	By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his parents, because they saw <i>he was</i> a proper child; and they were not afraid of the kingâ€™s commandment.	Hebrews 11 : 23	Flowers_0001_335	bgc-0008
Hebrews-11-24	By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaohâ€™s daughter;	Hebrews 11 : 24	Flowers_0001_336	bgc-0009
Hebrews-11-25	Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;	Hebrews 11 : 25	Flowers_0001_337	bgc-0010
Hebrews-11-26	Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of the reward.	Hebrews 11 : 26	Flowers_0001_338	bgc-0011
Hebrews-11-27	By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.	Hebrews 11 : 27	Flowers_0001_339	bgc-0012
Hebrews-11-28	Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.	Hebrews 11 : 28	Flowers_0001_340	bgc-0013
Hebrews-11-29	By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry <i>land</i>: which the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.	Hebrews 11 : 29	Flowers_0001_341	bgc-0014

Hebrews-11-31	By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, when she had received the spies with peace.	Hebrews 11 : 31	Flowers_0001_343	bgc-0016
Hebrews-11-32	And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon, and <i>of</i> Barak, and <i>of</i> Samson, and <i>of</i> Jephthae; <i>of</i> David also, and Samuel, and <i>of</i> the prophets:	Hebrews 11 : 32	Flowers_0001_1	bgc-0003
Hebrews-11-33	Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,	Hebrews 11 : 33	Flowers_0001_1	bgc-0003
Hebrews-11-34	Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the armies of the aliens.	Hebrews 11 : 34	Flowers_0001_2	bgc-0004
Hebrews-11-35	Women received their dead raised to life again: and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might obtain a better resurrection:	Hebrews 11 : 35	Flowers_0001_3	bgc-0005
Hebrews-11-36	And others had trial of <i>cruel</i> mockings and scourgings, yea, moreover of bonds and imprisonment:	Hebrews 11 : 36	Flowers_0001_4	bgc-0006
Hebrews-11-37	They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;	Hebrews 11 : 37	Flowers_0001_5	bgc-0007
Hebrews-11-38	(Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts, and <i>in</i> mountains, and <i>in</i> dens and caves of the earth.	Hebrews 11 : 38	Flowers_0001_6	bgc-0008
Hebrews-11-39	And these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received not the promise:	Hebrews 11 : 39	Flowers_0001_7	bgc-0009
Hebrews-11-40	God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.	Hebrews 11 : 40	Flowers_0001_8	bgc-0010
Hebrews-12-1	Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset <i>us</i>, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,	Hebrews 12 : 1	Flowers_0001_9	bgc-0011
Hebrews-12-2	Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of <i>our</i> faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.	Hebrews 12 : 2	Flowers_0001_10	bgc-0012
Hebrews-12-3	For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.	Hebrews 12 : 3	Flowers_0001_11	bgc-0013
Hebrews-12-4	Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.	Hebrews 12 : 4	Flowers_0001_12	bgc-0014
Hebrews-12-5	And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:	Hebrews 12 : 5	Flowers_0001_13	bgc-0015
Hebrews-12-6	For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth.	Hebrews 12 : 6	Flowers_0001_14	bgc-0016
Hebrews-12-7	If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?	Hebrews 12 : 7	Flowers_0001_15	bgc-0003
Hebrews-12-8	But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye bastards, and not sons.	Hebrews 12 : 8	Flowers_0001_16	bgc-0004
Hebrews-12-9	Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected <i>us</i>, and we gave <i>them</i> reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?	Hebrews 12 : 9	Flowers_0001_17	bgc-0005
Hebrews-12-10	For they verily for a few days chastened <i>us</i> after their own pleasure; but he for <i>our</i> profit, that <i>we</i> might be partakers of his holiness.	Hebrews 12 : 10	Flowers_0001_18	bgc-0006
Hebrews-12-11	Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.	Hebrews 12 : 11	Flowers_0001_19	bgc-0007
Hebrews-12-12	Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;	Hebrews 12 : 12	Flowers_0001_20	bgc-0008
Hebrews-12-13	And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.	Hebrews 12 : 13	Flowers_0001_21	bgc-0009
Hebrews-12-14	Follow peace with all <i>men</i>, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord:	Hebrews 12 : 14	Flowers_0001_22	bgc-0010
Hebrews-12-15	Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble <i>you</i>, and thereby many be defiled;	Hebrews 12 : 15	Flowers_0001_23	bgc-0011
Hebrews-12-16	Lest there <i>be</i> any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.	Hebrews 12 : 16	Flowers_0001_24	bgc-0012
Hebrews-12-17	For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.	Hebrews 12 : 17	Flowers_0001_25	bgc-0013
Hebrews-12-18	For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and tempest,	Hebrews 12 : 18	Flowers_0001_26	bgc-0014
Hebrews-12-19	And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which <i>voice</i> they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more:	Hebrews 12 : 19	Flowers_0001_27	bgc-0015
Hebrews-12-20	For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust through with a dart:	Hebrews 12 : 20	Flowers_0001_28	bgc-0016
Hebrews-12-21	And so terrible was the sight, <i>that</i> Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake:	Hebrews 12 : 21	Flowers_0001_29	bgc-0003
Hebrews-12-22	But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,	Hebrews 12 : 22	Flowers_0001_30	bgc-0004
Hebrews-12-23	To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,	Hebrews 12 : 23	Flowers_0001_31	bgc-0005
Hebrews-12-24	And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than <i>that of</i> Abel.	Hebrews 12 : 24	Flowers_0001_32	bgc-0006
Hebrews-12-25	See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more <i>shall not</i> we <i>escape</i>, if we turn away from him that <i>speaketh</i> from heaven:	Hebrews 12 : 25	Flowers_0001_33	bgc-0007
Hebrews-12-26	Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised, saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.	Hebrews 12 : 26	Flowers_0001_34	bgc-0008
Hebrews-12-27	And this <i>word</i>, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.	Hebrews 12 : 27	Flowers_0001_35	bgc-0009
Hebrews-12-28	Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear:	Hebrews 12 : 28	Flowers_0001_36	bgc-0010
Hebrews-12-29	For our God <i>is</i> a consuming fire.	Hebrews 12 : 29	Flowers_0001_37	bgc-0011
Hebrews-13-1	Let brotherly love continue.	Hebrews 13 : 1	Flowers_0001_38	bgc-0012
Hebrews-13-2	Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.	Hebrews 13 : 2	Flowers_0001_39	bgc-0013
Hebrews-13-3	Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; <i>and</i> them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.	Hebrews 13 : 3	Flowers_0001_40	bgc-0014
Hebrews-13-4	Marriage <i>is</i> honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.	Hebrews 13 : 4	Flowers_0001_41	bgc-0015
Hebrews-13-5	<i>Let your</i> conversation <i>be</i> without covetousness; <i>and be</i> content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.	Hebrews 13 : 5	Flowers_0001_42	bgc-0016
Hebrews-13-6	So that we may boldly say, The Lord <i>is</i> my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.	Hebrews 13 : 6	Flowers_0001_43	bgc-0003
Hebrews-13-7	Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of <i>their</i> conversation.	Hebrews 13 : 7	Flowers_0001_44	bgc-0004
Hebrews-13-8	Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.	Hebrews 13 : 8	Flowers_0001_45	bgc-0005
Hebrews-13-9	Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For <i>it is</i> a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.	Hebrews 13 : 9	Flowers_0001_46	bgc-0006
Hebrews-13-10	We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.	Hebrews 13 : 10	Flowers_0001_47	bgc-0007
Hebrews-13-11	For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.	Hebrews 13 : 11	Flowers_0001_48	bgc-0008
Hebrews-13-12	Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.	Hebrews 13 : 12	Flowers_0001_49	bgc-0009
Hebrews-13-13	Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.	Hebrews 13 : 13	Flowers_0001_50	bgc-0010
Hebrews-13-14	For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.	Hebrews 13 : 14	Flowers_0001_51	bgc-0011
Hebrews-13-15	By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of <i>our</i> lips giving thanks to his name.	Hebrews 13 : 15	Flowers_0001_52	bgc-0012
Hebrews-13-16	But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.	Hebrews 13 : 16	Flowers_0001_53	bgc-0013
Hebrews-13-17	Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that <i>is</i> unprofitable for you.	Hebrews 13 : 17	Flowers_0001_54	bgc-0014
Hebrews-13-18	Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.	Hebrews 13 : 18	Flowers_0001_55	bgc-0015
Hebrews-13-19	But I beseech <i>you</i> the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.	Hebrews 13 : 19	Flowers_0001_56	bgc-0016
Hebrews-13-20	Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,	Hebrews 13 : 20	Flowers_0001_57	bgc-0003
Hebrews-13-21	Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom <i>be</i> glory for ever and ever. Amen.	Hebrews 13 : 21	Flowers_0001_58	bgc-0004
Hebrews-13-22	And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words.	Hebrews 13 : 22	Flowers_0001_59	bgc-0005
Hebrews-13-23	Know ye that <i>our</i> brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.	Hebrews 13 : 23	Flowers_0001_60	bgc-0006
Hebrews-13-24	Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.	Hebrews 13 : 24	Flowers_0001_61	bgc-0007
Hebrews-13-25	Grace <i>be</i> with you all. Amen. 	Hebrews 13 : 25	Flowers_0001_62	bgc-0008
James-1-1	James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.	James 1 : 1	Flowers_0001_63	bgc-0009
James-1-2	My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;	James 1 : 2	Flowers_0001_64	bgc-0010
James-1-3	Knowing <i>this</i>, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.	James 1 : 3	Flowers_0001_65	bgc-0011
James-1-4	But let patience have <i>her</i> perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.	James 1 : 4	Flowers_0001_66	bgc-0012
James-1-5	If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all <i>men</i> liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.	James 1 : 5	Flowers_0001_67	bgc-0013
James-1-6	But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.	James 1 : 6	Flowers_0001_68	bgc-0014
James-1-7	For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.	James 1 : 7	Flowers_0001_69	bgc-0015
James-1-8	A double minded man <i>is</i> unstable in all his ways.	James 1 : 8	Flowers_0001_70	bgc-0016
James-1-9	Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:	James 1 : 9	Flowers_0001_71	bgc-0003
James-1-10	But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.	James 1 : 10	Flowers_0001_72	bgc-0004
James-1-11	For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.	James 1 : 11	Flowers_0001_73	bgc-0005
James-1-12	Blessed <i>is</i> the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.	James 1 : 12	Flowers_0001_74	bgc-0006
James-1-13	Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:	James 1 : 13	Flowers_0001_75	bgc-0007
James-1-14	But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.	James 1 : 14	Flowers_0001_76	bgc-0008
James-1-15	Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.	James 1 : 15	Flowers_0001_77	bgc-0009
James-1-16	Do not err, my beloved brethren.	James 1 : 16	Flowers_0001_78	bgc-0010
James-1-17	Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.	James 1 : 17	Flowers_0001_79	bgc-0011
James-1-18	Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.	James 1 : 18	Flowers_0001_80	bgc-0012
James-1-19	Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:	James 1 : 19	Flowers_0001_81	bgc-0013
James-1-20	For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.	James 1 : 20	Flowers_0001_82	bgc-0014
James-1-21	Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.	James 1 : 21	Flowers_0001_83	bgc-0015
James-1-22	But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.	James 1 : 22	Flowers_0001_84	bgc-0016
James-1-23	For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:	James 1 : 23	Flowers_0001_85	bgc-0003
James-1-24	For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.	James 1 : 24	Flowers_0001_86	bgc-0004
James-1-25	But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth <i>therein</i>, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.	James 1 : 25	Flowers_0001_87	bgc-0005
James-1-26	If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this manâ€™s religion <i>is</i> vain.	James 1 : 26	Flowers_0001_88	bgc-0006
James-1-27	Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, <i>and</i> to keep himself unspotted from the world.	James 1 : 27	Flowers_0001_89	bgc-0007
James-2-1	My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, <i>the Lord</i> of glory, with respect of persons.	James 2 : 1	Flowers_0001_90	bgc-0008
James-2-2	For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;	James 2 : 2	Flowers_0001_91	bgc-0009
James-2-3	And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:	James 2 : 3	Flowers_0001_92	bgc-0010
James-2-4	Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?	James 2 : 4	Flowers_0001_93	bgc-0011
James-2-5	Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?	James 2 : 5	Flowers_0001_94	bgc-0012
James-2-6	But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?	James 2 : 6	Flowers_0001_95	bgc-0013
James-2-7	Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?	James 2 : 7	Flowers_0001_96	bgc-0014
James-2-8	If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:	James 2 : 8	Flowers_0001_97	bgc-0015
James-2-9	But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.	James 2 : 9	Flowers_0001_98	bgc-0016
James-2-10	For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one <i>point</i>, he is guilty of all.	James 2 : 10	Flowers_0001_99	bgc-0003
James-2-11	For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.	James 2 : 11	Flowers_0001_100	bgc-0004
James-2-12	So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.	James 2 : 12	Flowers_0001_101	bgc-0005
James-2-13	For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.	James 2 : 13	Flowers_0001_102	bgc-0006
James-2-14	What <i>doth it</i> profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?	James 2 : 14	Flowers_0001_103	bgc-0007
James-2-15	If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,	James 2 : 15	Flowers_0001_104	bgc-0008
James-2-16	And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be <i>ye</i> warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what <i>doth it</i> profit?	James 2 : 16	Flowers_0001_105	bgc-0009
James-2-17	Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.	James 2 : 17	Flowers_0001_106	bgc-0010
James-2-18	Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.	James 2 : 18	Flowers_0001_107	bgc-0011
James-2-19	Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.	James 2 : 19	Flowers_0001_108	bgc-0012
James-2-20	But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?	James 2 : 20	Flowers_0001_109	bgc-0013
James-2-21	Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?	James 2 : 21	Flowers_0001_110	bgc-0014
James-2-22	Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?	James 2 : 22	Flowers_0001_111	bgc-0015
James-2-23	And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.	James 2 : 23	Flowers_0001_112	bgc-0016
James-2-24	Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.	James 2 : 24	Flowers_0001_113	bgc-0003
James-2-25	Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent <i>them</i> out another way?	James 2 : 25	Flowers_0001_114	bgc-0004
James-2-26	For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.	James 2 : 26	Flowers_0001_115	bgc-0005
James-3-1	My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.	James 3 : 1	Flowers_0001_116	bgc-0006
James-3-2	For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same <i>is</i> a perfect man, <i>and</i> able also to bridle the whole body.	James 3 : 2	Flowers_0001_117	bgc-0007
James-3-3	Behold, we put bits in the horsesâ€™ mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.	James 3 : 3	Flowers_0001_118	bgc-0008
James-3-4	Behold also the ships, which though <i>they be</i> so great, and <i>are</i> driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.	James 3 : 4	Flowers_0001_119	bgc-0009
James-3-5	Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!	James 3 : 5	Flowers_0001_120	bgc-0010
James-3-6	And the tongue <i>is</i> a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.	James 3 : 6	Flowers_0001_121	bgc-0011
James-3-7	For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:	James 3 : 7	Flowers_0001_122	bgc-0012
James-3-8	But the tongue can no man tame; <i>it is</i> an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.	James 3 : 8	Flowers_0001_123	bgc-0013
James-3-9	Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.	James 3 : 9	Flowers_0001_124	bgc-0014
James-3-10	Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.	James 3 : 10	Flowers_0001_125	bgc-0015
James-3-11	Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet <i>water</i> and bitter?	James 3 : 11	Flowers_0001_126	bgc-0016
James-3-12	Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so <i>can</i> no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.	James 3 : 12	Flowers_0001_127	bgc-0003
James-3-13	Who <i>is</i> a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.	James 3 : 13	Flowers_0001_128	bgc-0004
James-3-14	But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.	James 3 : 14	Flowers_0001_129	bgc-0005
James-3-15	This wisdom descendeth not from above, but <i>is</i> earthly, sensual, devilish.	James 3 : 15	Flowers_0001_130	bgc-0006
James-3-16	For where envying and strife <i>is</i>, there <i>is</i> confusion and every evil work.	James 3 : 16	Flowers_0001_131	bgc-0007
James-3-17	But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, <i>and</i> easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.	James 3 : 17	Flowers_0001_132	bgc-0008
James-3-18	And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.	James 3 : 18	Flowers_0001_133	bgc-0009
James-4-1	From whence <i>come</i> wars and fightings among you? <i>come they</i> not hence, <i>even</i> of your lusts that war in your members?	James 4 : 1	Flowers_0001_134	bgc-0010
James-4-2	Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.	James 4 : 2	Flowers_0001_135	bgc-0011
James-4-3	Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume <i>it</i> upon your lusts.	James 4 : 3	Flowers_0001_136	bgc-0012
James-4-4	Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.	James 4 : 4	Flowers_0001_137	bgc-0013
James-4-5	Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?	James 4 : 5	Flowers_0001_138	bgc-0014
James-4-6	But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.	James 4 : 6	Flowers_0001_139	bgc-0015
James-4-7	Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.	James 4 : 7	Flowers_0001_140	bgc-0016
James-4-8	Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse <i>your</i> hands, <i>ye</i> sinners; and purify <i>your</i> hearts, <i>ye</i> double minded.	James 4 : 8	Flowers_0001_141	bgc-0003
James-4-9	Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and <i>your</i> joy to heaviness.	James 4 : 9	Flowers_0001_142	bgc-0004
James-4-10	Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.	James 4 : 10	Flowers_0001_143	bgc-0005
James-4-11	Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of <i>his</i> brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.	James 4 : 11	Flowers_0001_144	bgc-0006
James-4-12	There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?	James 4 : 12	Flowers_0001_145	bgc-0007
James-4-13	Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:	James 4 : 13	Flowers_0001_146	bgc-0008
James-4-14	Whereas ye know not what <i>shall be</i> on the morrow. For what <i>is</i> your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.	James 4 : 14	Flowers_0001_147	bgc-0009
James-4-15	For that ye <i>ought</i> to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.	James 4 : 15	Flowers_0001_148	bgc-0010
James-4-16	But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.	James 4 : 16	Flowers_0001_149	bgc-0011
James-4-17	Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth <i>it</i> not, to him it is sin.	James 4 : 17	Flowers_0001_150	bgc-0012
James-5-1	Go to now, <i>ye</i> rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon <i>you</i>.	James 5 : 1	Flowers_0001_151	bgc-0013
James-5-2	Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.	James 5 : 2	Flowers_0001_152	bgc-0014
James-5-3	Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.	James 5 : 3	Flowers_0001_153	bgc-0015
James-5-4	Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.	James 5 : 4	Flowers_0001_154	bgc-0016
James-5-5	Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.	James 5 : 5	Flowers_0001_155	bgc-0003
James-5-6	Ye have condemned <i>and</i> killed the just; <i>and</i> he doth not resist you.	James 5 : 6	Flowers_0001_156	bgc-0004
James-5-7	Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.	James 5 : 7	Flowers_0001_157	bgc-0005
James-5-8	Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draweth nigh.	James 5 : 8	Flowers_0001_158	bgc-0006
James-5-9	Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door.	James 5 : 9	Flowers_0001_159	bgc-0007
James-5-10	Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.	James 5 : 10	Flowers_0001_160	bgc-0008
James-5-11	Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.	James 5 : 11	Flowers_0001_161	bgc-0009
James-5-12	But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yea be yea; and <i>your</i> nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation.	James 5 : 12	Flowers_0001_162	bgc-0010
James-5-13	Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let him sing psalms.	James 5 : 13	Flowers_0001_163	bgc-0011
James-5-14	Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:	James 5 : 14	Flowers_0001_164	bgc-0012
James-5-15	And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him.	James 5 : 15	Flowers_0001_165	bgc-0013
James-5-16	Confess <i>your</i> faults one to another, and pray one for another, that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much.	James 5 : 16	Flowers_0001_166	bgc-0014
James-5-17	Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.	James 5 : 17	Flowers_0001_167	bgc-0015
James-5-18	And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.	James 5 : 18	Flowers_0001_168	bgc-0016
James-5-19	Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert him;	James 5 : 19	Flowers_0001_169	bgc-0003
James-5-20	Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.	James 5 : 20	Flowers_0001_170	bgc-0004
1-Peter-1-1	Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,	1-Peter 1 : 1	Flowers_0001_171	bgc-0005
1-Peter-1-2	Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.	1-Peter 1 : 2	Flowers_0001_172	bgc-0006
1-Peter-1-3	Blessed <i>be</i> the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,	1-Peter 1 : 3	Flowers_0001_173	bgc-0007
1-Peter-1-4	To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,	1-Peter 1 : 4	Flowers_0001_174	bgc-0008
1-Peter-1-5	Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.	1-Peter 1 : 5	Flowers_0001_175	bgc-0009
1-Peter-1-6	Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:	1-Peter 1 : 6	Flowers_0001_176	bgc-0010
1-Peter-1-7	That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ:	1-Peter 1 : 7	Flowers_0001_177	bgc-0011
1-Peter-1-8	Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see <i>him</i> not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:	1-Peter 1 : 8	Flowers_0001_178	bgc-0012
1-Peter-1-9	Receiving the end of your faith, <i>even</i> the salvation of <i>your</i> souls.	1-Peter 1 : 9	Flowers_0001_179	bgc-0013
1-Peter-1-10	Of which salvation the prophets have inquired and searched diligently, who prophesied of the grace <i>that should come</i> unto you:	1-Peter 1 : 10	Flowers_0001_180	bgc-0014
1-Peter-1-11	Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.	1-Peter 1 : 11	Flowers_0001_181	bgc-0015
1-Peter-1-12	Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.	1-Peter 1 : 12	Flowers_0001_182	bgc-0016
1-Peter-1-13	Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;	1-Peter 1 : 13	Flowers_0001_183	bgc-0003
1-Peter-1-14	As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance:	1-Peter 1 : 14	Flowers_0001_184	bgc-0004
1-Peter-1-15	But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;	1-Peter 1 : 15	Flowers_0001_185	bgc-0005
1-Peter-1-16	Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.	1-Peter 1 : 16	Flowers_0001_186	bgc-0006
1-Peter-1-17	And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judgeth according to every manâ€™s work, pass the time of your sojourning <i>here</i> in fear:	1-Peter 1 : 17	Flowers_0001_187	bgc-0007
1-Peter-1-18	Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, <i>as</i> silver and gold, from your vain conversation <i>received</i> by tradition from your fathers;	1-Peter 1 : 18	Flowers_0001_188	bgc-0008
1-Peter-1-19	But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:	1-Peter 1 : 19	Flowers_0001_189	bgc-0009
1-Peter-1-20	Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for you,	1-Peter 1 : 20	Flowers_0001_190	bgc-0010
1-Peter-1-21	Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in God.	1-Peter 1 : 21	Flowers_0001_191	bgc-0011
1-Peter-1-22	Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, <i>see that ye</i> love one another with a pure heart fervently:	1-Peter 1 : 22	Flowers_0001_192	bgc-0012
1-Peter-1-23	Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.	1-Peter 1 : 23	Flowers_0001_193	bgc-0013
1-Peter-1-24	For all flesh <i>is</i> as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof falleth away:	1-Peter 1 : 24	Flowers_0001_194	bgc-0014
1-Peter-1-25	But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.	1-Peter 1 : 25	Flowers_0001_195	bgc-0015
1-Peter-2-1	Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,	1-Peter 2 : 1	Flowers_0001_196	bgc-0016
1-Peter-2-2	As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:	1-Peter 2 : 2	Flowers_0001_197	bgc-0003
1-Peter-2-3	If so be ye have tasted that the Lord <i>is</i> gracious.	1-Peter 2 : 3	Flowers_0001_198	bgc-0004
1-Peter-2-4	To whom coming, <i>as unto</i> a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, <i>and</i> precious,	1-Peter 2 : 4	Flowers_0001_199	bgc-0005
1-Peter-2-5	Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.	1-Peter 2 : 5	Flowers_0001_200	bgc-0006
1-Peter-2-6	Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.	1-Peter 2 : 6	Flowers_0001_201	bgc-0007
1-Peter-2-7	Unto you therefore which believe <i>he is</i> precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,	1-Peter 2 : 7	Flowers_0001_202	bgc-0008
1-Peter-2-8	And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, <i>even to them</i> which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.	1-Peter 2 : 8	Flowers_0001_203	bgc-0009
1-Peter-2-9	But ye <i>are</i> a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:	1-Peter 2 : 9	Flowers_0001_204	bgc-0010
1-Peter-2-10	Which in time past <i>were</i> not a people, but <i>are</i> now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.	1-Peter 2 : 10	Flowers_0001_205	bgc-0011
1-Peter-2-11	Dearly beloved, I beseech <i>you</i> as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;	1-Peter 2 : 11	Flowers_0001_206	bgc-0012
1-Peter-2-12	Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by <i>your</i> good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.	1-Peter 2 : 12	Flowers_0001_207	bgc-0013
1-Peter-2-13	Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lordâ€™s sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;	1-Peter 2 : 13	Flowers_0001_208	bgc-0014
1-Peter-2-14	Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.	1-Peter 2 : 14	Flowers_0001_209	bgc-0015
1-Peter-2-15	For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:	1-Peter 2 : 15	Flowers_0001_210	bgc-0016
1-Peter-2-16	As free, and not using <i>your</i> liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.	1-Peter 2 : 16	Flowers_0001_211	bgc-0003
1-Peter-2-17	Honour all <i>men</i>. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.	1-Peter 2 : 17	Flowers_0001_212	bgc-0004
1-Peter-2-18	Servants, <i>be</i> subject to <i>your</i> masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.	1-Peter 2 : 18	Flowers_0001_213	bgc-0005
1-Peter-2-19	For this <i>is</i> thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.	1-Peter 2 : 19	Flowers_0001_214	bgc-0006
1-Peter-2-20	For what glory <i>is it</i>, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer <i>for it</i>, ye take it patiently, this <i>is</i> acceptable with God.	1-Peter 2 : 20	Flowers_0001_215	bgc-0007
1-Peter-2-21	For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:	1-Peter 2 : 21	Flowers_0001_216	bgc-0008
1-Peter-2-22	Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:	1-Peter 2 : 22	Flowers_0001_217	bgc-0009
1-Peter-2-23	Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed <i>himself</i> to him that judgeth righteously:	1-Peter 2 : 23	Flowers_0001_218	bgc-0010
1-Peter-2-24	Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.	1-Peter 2 : 24	Flowers_0001_219	bgc-0011
1-Peter-2-25	For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.	1-Peter 2 : 25	Flowers_0001_220	bgc-0012
1-Peter-3-1	Likewise, ye wives, <i>be</i> in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;	1-Peter 3 : 1	Flowers_0001_221	bgc-0013
1-Peter-3-2	While they behold your chaste conversation <i>coupled</i> with fear.	1-Peter 3 : 2	Flowers_0001_222	bgc-0014
1-Peter-3-3	Whose adorning let it not be that outward <i>adorning</i> of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;	1-Peter 3 : 3	Flowers_0001_223	bgc-0015
1-Peter-3-4	But <i>let it be</i> the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, <i>even the ornament</i> of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.	1-Peter 3 : 4	Flowers_0001_224	bgc-0016
1-Peter-3-5	For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands:	1-Peter 3 : 5	Flowers_0001_225	bgc-0003
1-Peter-3-6	Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.	1-Peter 3 : 6	Flowers_0001_226	bgc-0004
1-Peter-3-7	Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with <i>them</i> according to knowledge, giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.	1-Peter 3 : 7	Flowers_0001_227	bgc-0005
1-Peter-3-8	Finally, <i>be ye</i> all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brethren, <i>be</i> pitiful, <i>be</i> courteous:	1-Peter 3 : 8	Flowers_0001_228	bgc-0006
1-Peter-3-9	Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.	1-Peter 3 : 9	Flowers_0001_229	bgc-0007
1-Peter-3-10	For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:	1-Peter 3 : 10	Flowers_0001_230	bgc-0008
1-Peter-3-11	Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.	1-Peter 3 : 11	Flowers_0001_231	bgc-0009
1-Peter-3-12	For the eyes of the Lord <i>are</i> over the righteous, and his ears <i>are open</i> unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord <i>is</i> against them that do evil.	1-Peter 3 : 12	Flowers_0001_232	bgc-0010
1-Peter-3-13	And who <i>is</i> he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good?	1-Peter 3 : 13	Flowers_0001_233	bgc-0011
1-Peter-3-14	But and if ye suffer for righteousnessâ€™ sake, happy <i>are ye</i>: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;	1-Peter 3 : 14	Flowers_0001_234	bgc-0012
1-Peter-3-15	But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and <i>be</i> ready always to <i>give</i> an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:	1-Peter 3 : 15	Flowers_0001_235	bgc-0013
1-Peter-3-16	Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.	1-Peter 3 : 16	Flowers_0001_236	bgc-0014
1-Peter-3-17	For <i>it is</i> better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.	1-Peter 3 : 17	Flowers_0001_237	bgc-0015
1-Peter-3-18	For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:	1-Peter 3 : 18	Flowers_0001_238	bgc-0016
1-Peter-3-19	By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;	1-Peter 3 : 19	Flowers_0001_239	bgc-0003
1-Peter-3-20	Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.	1-Peter 3 : 20	Flowers_0001_240	bgc-0004
1-Peter-3-21	The like figure whereunto <i>even</i> baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:	1-Peter 3 : 21	Flowers_0001_241	bgc-0005
1-Peter-3-22	Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.	1-Peter 3 : 22	Flowers_0001_242	bgc-0006
1-Peter-4-1	Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;	1-Peter 4 : 1	Flowers_0001_243	bgc-0007
1-Peter-4-2	That he no longer should live the rest of <i>his</i> time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.	1-Peter 4 : 2	Flowers_0001_244	bgc-0008
1-Peter-4-3	For the time past of <i>our</i> life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:	1-Peter 4 : 3	Flowers_0001_245	bgc-0009
1-Peter-4-4	Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with <i>them</i> to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of <i>you</i>:	1-Peter 4 : 4	Flowers_0001_246	bgc-0010
1-Peter-4-5	Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead.	1-Peter 4 : 5	Flowers_0001_247	bgc-0011
1-Peter-4-6	For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.	1-Peter 4 : 6	Flowers_0001_248	bgc-0012
1-Peter-4-7	But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch unto prayer.	1-Peter 4 : 7	Flowers_0001_249	bgc-0013
1-Peter-4-8	And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.	1-Peter 4 : 8	Flowers_0001_250	bgc-0014
1-Peter-4-9	Use hospitality one to another without grudging.	1-Peter 4 : 9	Flowers_0001_251	bgc-0015
1-Peter-4-10	As every man hath received the gift, <i>even so</i> minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.	1-Peter 4 : 10	Flowers_0001_252	bgc-0016
1-Peter-4-11	If any man speak, <i>let him speak</i> as the oracles of God; if any man minister, <i>let him do it</i> as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.	1-Peter 4 : 11	Flowers_0001_253	bgc-0003
1-Peter-4-12	Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:	1-Peter 4 : 12	Flowers_0001_254	bgc-0004
1-Peter-4-13	But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christâ€™s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.	1-Peter 4 : 13	Flowers_0001_255	bgc-0005
1-Peter-4-14	If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy <i>are ye</i>; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.	1-Peter 4 : 14	Flowers_0001_256	bgc-0006
1-Peter-4-15	But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or <i>as</i> a thief, or <i>as</i> an evildoer, or as a busybody in other menâ€™s matters.	1-Peter 4 : 15	Flowers_0001_257	bgc-0007
1-Peter-4-16	Yet if <i>any man suffer</i> as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.	1-Peter 4 : 16	Flowers_0001_258	bgc-0008
1-Peter-4-17	For the time <i>is come</i> that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if <i>it</i> first <i>begin</i> at us, what shall the end <i>be</i> of them that obey not the gospel of God?	1-Peter 4 : 17	Flowers_0001_259	bgc-0009
1-Peter-4-18	And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?	1-Peter 4 : 18	Flowers_0001_260	bgc-0010
1-Peter-4-19	Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls <i>to him</i> in well doing, as unto a faithful Creator.	1-Peter 4 : 19	Flowers_0001_261	bgc-0011
1-Peter-5-1	The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:	1-Peter 5 : 1	Flowers_0001_262	bgc-0012
1-Peter-5-2	Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight <i>thereof</i>, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;	1-Peter 5 : 2	Flowers_0001_263	bgc-0013
1-Peter-5-3	Neither as being lords over <i>Godâ€™s</i> heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.	1-Peter 5 : 3	Flowers_0001_264	bgc-0014
1-Peter-5-4	And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.	1-Peter 5 : 4	Flowers_0001_265	bgc-0015
1-Peter-5-5	Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all <i>of you</i> be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.	1-Peter 5 : 5	Flowers_0001_266	bgc-0016
1-Peter-5-6	Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:	1-Peter 5 : 6	Flowers_0001_267	bgc-0003
1-Peter-5-7	Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.	1-Peter 5 : 7	Flowers_0001_268	bgc-0004
1-Peter-5-8	Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:	1-Peter 5 : 8	Flowers_0001_269	bgc-0005
1-Peter-5-9	Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.	1-Peter 5 : 9	Flowers_0001_270	bgc-0006
1-Peter-5-10	But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle <i>you</i>.	1-Peter 5 : 10	Flowers_0001_271	bgc-0007
1-Peter-5-11	To him <i>be</i> glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.	1-Peter 5 : 11	Flowers_0001_272	bgc-0008
1-Peter-5-12	By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.	1-Peter 5 : 12	Flowers_0001_273	bgc-0009
1-Peter-5-13	The <i>church that is</i> at Babylon, elected together with <i>you</i>, saluteth you; and <i>so doth</i> Marcus my son.	1-Peter 5 : 13	Flowers_0001_274	bgc-0010
1-Peter-5-14	Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace <i>be</i> with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.	1-Peter 5 : 14	Flowers_0001_275	bgc-0011
2-Peter-1-1	Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:	2-Peter 1 : 1	Flowers_0001_276	bgc-0012
2-Peter-1-2	Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,	2-Peter 1 : 2	Flowers_0001_277	bgc-0013
2-Peter-1-3	According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that <i>pertain</i> unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:	2-Peter 1 : 3	Flowers_0001_278	bgc-0014
2-Peter-1-4	Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.	2-Peter 1 : 4	Flowers_0001_279	bgc-0015
2-Peter-1-5	And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;	2-Peter 1 : 5	Flowers_0001_280	bgc-0016
2-Peter-1-6	And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;	2-Peter 1 : 6	Flowers_0001_281	bgc-0003
2-Peter-1-7	And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.	2-Peter 1 : 7	Flowers_0001_282	bgc-0004
2-Peter-1-8	For if these things be in you, and abound, they make <i>you that ye shall</i> neither <i>be</i> barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.	2-Peter 1 : 8	Flowers_0001_283	bgc-0005
2-Peter-1-9	But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.	2-Peter 1 : 9	Flowers_0001_284	bgc-0006
2-Peter-1-10	Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:	2-Peter 1 : 10	Flowers_0001_285	bgc-0007
2-Peter-1-11	For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.	2-Peter 1 : 11	Flowers_0001_286	bgc-0008
2-Peter-1-12	Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know <i>them</i>, and be established in the present truth.	2-Peter 1 : 12	Flowers_0001_287	bgc-0009
2-Peter-1-13	Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting <i>you</i> in remembrance;	2-Peter 1 : 13	Flowers_0001_288	bgc-0010
2-Peter-1-14	Knowing that shortly I must put off <i>this</i> my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.	2-Peter 1 : 14	Flowers_0001_289	bgc-0011
2-Peter-1-15	Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.	2-Peter 1 : 15	Flowers_0001_290	bgc-0012
2-Peter-1-16	For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.	2-Peter 1 : 16	Flowers_0001_291	bgc-0013
2-Peter-1-17	For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.	2-Peter 1 : 17	Flowers_0001_292	bgc-0014
2-Peter-1-18	And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.	2-Peter 1 : 18	Flowers_0001_293	bgc-0015
2-Peter-1-19	We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:	2-Peter 1 : 19	Flowers_0001_294	bgc-0016
2-Peter-1-20	Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.	2-Peter 1 : 20	Flowers_0001_295	bgc-0003
2-Peter-1-21	For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake <i>as they were</i> moved by the Holy Ghost.	2-Peter 1 : 21	Flowers_0001_296	bgc-0004
2-Peter-2-1	But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.	2-Peter 2 : 1	Flowers_0001_297	bgc-0005
2-Peter-2-2	And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.	2-Peter 2 : 2	Flowers_0001_298	bgc-0006
2-Peter-2-3	And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.	2-Peter 2 : 3	Flowers_0001_299	bgc-0007
2-Peter-2-4	For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast <i>them</i> down to hell, and delivered <i>them</i> into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;	2-Peter 2 : 4	Flowers_0001_300	bgc-0008
2-Peter-2-5	And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth <i>person</i>, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;	2-Peter 2 : 5	Flowers_0001_301	bgc-0009
2-Peter-2-6	And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned <i>them</i> with an overthrow, making <i>them</i> an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;	2-Peter 2 : 6	Flowers_0001_302	bgc-0010
2-Peter-2-7	And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked:	2-Peter 2 : 7	Flowers_0001_303	bgc-0011
2-Peter-2-8	(For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed <i>his</i> righteous soul from day to day with <i>their</i> unlawful deeds;)	2-Peter 2 : 8	Flowers_0001_304	bgc-0012
2-Peter-2-9	The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished:	2-Peter 2 : 9	Flowers_0001_305	bgc-0013
2-Peter-2-10	But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous <i>are they</i>, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.	2-Peter 2 : 10	Flowers_0001_306	bgc-0014
2-Peter-2-11	Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord.	2-Peter 2 : 11	Flowers_0001_307	bgc-0015
2-Peter-2-12	But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not; and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;	2-Peter 2 : 12	Flowers_0001_308	bgc-0016
2-Peter-2-13	And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, <i>as</i> they that count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots <i>they are</i> and blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while they feast with you;	2-Peter 2 : 13	Flowers_0001_309	bgc-0003
2-Peter-2-14	Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with covetous practices; cursed children:	2-Peter 2 : 14	Flowers_0001_310	bgc-0004
2-Peter-2-15	Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray, following the way of Balaam <i>the son</i> of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;	2-Peter 2 : 15	Flowers_0001_311	bgc-0005
2-Peter-2-16	But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with manâ€™s voice forbad the madness of the prophet.	2-Peter 2 : 16	Flowers_0001_312	bgc-0006
2-Peter-2-17	These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.	2-Peter 2 : 17	Flowers_0001_313	bgc-0007
2-Peter-2-18	For when they speak great swelling <i>words</i> of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, <i>through much</i> wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live in error.	2-Peter 2 : 18	Flowers_0001_314	bgc-0008
2-Peter-2-19	While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the same is he brought in bondage.	2-Peter 2 : 19	Flowers_0001_315	bgc-0009
2-Peter-2-20	For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning.	2-Peter 2 : 20	Flowers_0001_316	bgc-0010
2-Peter-2-21	For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known <i>it</i>, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.	2-Peter 2 : 21	Flowers_0001_317	bgc-0011
2-Peter-2-22	But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog <i>is</i> turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.	2-Peter 2 : 22	Flowers_0001_318	bgc-0012
2-Peter-3-1	This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in <i>both</i> which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:	2-Peter 3 : 1	Flowers_0001_319	bgc-0013
2-Peter-3-2	That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:	2-Peter 3 : 2	Flowers_0001_320	bgc-0014
2-Peter-3-3	Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,	2-Peter 3 : 3	Flowers_0001_321	bgc-0015
2-Peter-3-4	And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as <i>they were</i> from the beginning of the creation.	2-Peter 3 : 4	Flowers_0001_322	bgc-0016
2-Peter-3-5	For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:	2-Peter 3 : 5	Flowers_0001_323	bgc-0003
2-Peter-3-6	Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:	2-Peter 3 : 6	Flowers_0001_324	bgc-0004
2-Peter-3-7	But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.	2-Peter 3 : 7	Flowers_0001_325	bgc-0005
2-Peter-3-8	But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day <i>is</i> with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.	2-Peter 3 : 8	Flowers_0001_326	bgc-0006
2-Peter-3-9	The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.	2-Peter 3 : 9	Flowers_0001_327	bgc-0007
2-Peter-3-10	But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.	2-Peter 3 : 10	Flowers_0001_328	bgc-0008
2-Peter-3-11	<i>Seeing</i> then <i>that</i> all these things shall be dissolved, what manner <i>of persons</i> ought ye to be in <i>all</i> holy conversation and godliness,	2-Peter 3 : 11	Flowers_0001_329	bgc-0009
2-Peter-3-12	Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?	2-Peter 3 : 12	Flowers_0001_330	bgc-0010
2-Peter-3-13	Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.	2-Peter 3 : 13	Flowers_0001_331	bgc-0011
2-Peter-3-14	Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.	2-Peter 3 : 14	Flowers_0001_332	bgc-0012
2-Peter-3-15	And account <i>that</i> the longsuffering of our Lord <i>is</i> salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;	2-Peter 3 : 15	Flowers_0001_333	bgc-0013
2-Peter-3-16	As also in all <i>his</i> epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as <i>they do</i> also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.	2-Peter 3 : 16	Flowers_0001_334	bgc-0014
2-Peter-3-17	Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know <i>these things</i> before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.	2-Peter 3 : 17	Flowers_0001_335	bgc-0015
2-Peter-3-18	But grow in grace, and <i>in</i> the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him <i>be</i> glory both now and for ever. Amen.	2-Peter 3 : 18	Flowers_0001_336	bgc-0016
1-John-1-1	That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;	1-John 1 : 1	Flowers_0001_337	bgc-0003
1-John-1-2	(For the life was manifested, and we have seen <i>it</i>, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)	1-John 1 : 2	Flowers_0001_338	bgc-0004
1-John-1-3	That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship <i>is</i> with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.	1-John 1 : 3	Flowers_0001_339	bgc-0005
1-John-1-4	And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.	1-John 1 : 4	Flowers_0001_340	bgc-0006
1-John-1-5	This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.	1-John 1 : 5	Flowers_0001_341	bgc-0007
1-John-1-6	If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:	1-John 1 : 6	Flowers_0001_342	bgc-0008
1-John-1-7	But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.	1-John 1 : 7	Flowers_0001_343	bgc-0009
1-John-1-8	If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.	1-John 1 : 8	Flowers_0001_1	bgc-0010
1-John-1-9	If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us <i>our</i> sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.	1-John 1 : 9	Flowers_0001_2	bgc-0011
1-John-1-10	If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.	1-John 1 : 10	Flowers_0001_3	bgc-0012
1-John-2-1	My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:	1-John 2 : 1	Flowers_0001_4	bgc-0013
1-John-2-2	And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for <i>the sins of</i> the whole world.	1-John 2 : 2	Flowers_0001_5	bgc-0014
1-John-2-3	And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.	1-John 2 : 3	Flowers_0001_6	bgc-0015
1-John-2-4	He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.	1-John 2 : 4	Flowers_0001_7	bgc-0016
1-John-2-5	But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.	1-John 2 : 5	Flowers_0001_8	bgc-0003
1-John-2-6	He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.	1-John 2 : 6	Flowers_0001_9	bgc-0004
1-John-2-7	Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.	1-John 2 : 7	Flowers_0001_10	bgc-0005
1-John-2-8	Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true light now shineth.	1-John 2 : 8	Flowers_0001_11	bgc-0006
1-John-2-9	He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness even until now.	1-John 2 : 9	Flowers_0001_12	bgc-0007
1-John-2-10	He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.	1-John 2 : 10	Flowers_0001_13	bgc-0008
1-John-2-11	But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.	1-John 2 : 11	Flowers_0001_14	bgc-0009
1-John-2-12	I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you for his nameâ€™s sake.	1-John 2 : 12	Flowers_0001_15	bgc-0010
1-John-2-13	I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him <i>that is</i> from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, because ye have known the Father.	1-John 2 : 13	Flowers_0001_16	bgc-0011
1-John-2-14	I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him <i>that is</i> from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.	1-John 2 : 14	Flowers_0001_17	bgc-0012
1-John-2-15	Love not the world, neither the things <i>that are</i> in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.	1-John 2 : 15	Flowers_0001_18	bgc-0013
1-John-2-16	For all that <i>is</i> in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.	1-John 2 : 16	Flowers_0001_19	bgc-0014
1-John-2-17	And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that doeth the will of God abideth for ever.	1-John 2 : 17	Flowers_0001_20	bgc-0015
1-John-2-18	Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.	1-John 2 : 18	Flowers_0001_21	bgc-0016
1-John-2-19	They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would <i>no doubt</i> have continued with us: but <i>they went out</i>, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.	1-John 2 : 19	Flowers_0001_22	bgc-0003
1-John-2-20	But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things.	1-John 2 : 20	Flowers_0001_23	bgc-0004
1-John-2-21	I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.	1-John 2 : 21	Flowers_0001_24	bgc-0005
1-John-2-22	Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.	1-John 2 : 22	Flowers_0001_25	bgc-0006
1-John-2-23	Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: (<i>but) he that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also</i>.	1-John 2 : 23	Flowers_0001_26	bgc-0007
1-John-2-24	Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Father.	1-John 2 : 24	Flowers_0001_27	bgc-0008
1-John-2-25	And this is the promise that he hath promised us, <i>even</i> eternal life.	1-John 2 : 25	Flowers_0001_28	bgc-0009
1-John-2-26	These <i>things</i> have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you.	1-John 2 : 26	Flowers_0001_29	bgc-0010
1-John-2-27	But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.	1-John 2 : 27	Flowers_0001_30	bgc-0011
1-John-2-28	And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.	1-John 2 : 28	Flowers_0001_31	bgc-0012
1-John-2-29	If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.	1-John 2 : 29	Flowers_0001_32	bgc-0013
1-John-3-1	Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.	1-John 3 : 1	Flowers_0001_33	bgc-0014
1-John-3-2	Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.	1-John 3 : 2	Flowers_0001_34	bgc-0015
1-John-3-3	And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.	1-John 3 : 3	Flowers_0001_35	bgc-0016
1-John-3-4	Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.	1-John 3 : 4	Flowers_0001_36	bgc-0003
1-John-3-5	And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.	1-John 3 : 5	Flowers_0001_37	bgc-0004
1-John-3-6	Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.	1-John 3 : 6	Flowers_0001_38	bgc-0005
1-John-3-7	Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.	1-John 3 : 7	Flowers_0001_39	bgc-0006
1-John-3-8	He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.	1-John 3 : 8	Flowers_0001_40	bgc-0007
1-John-3-9	Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.	1-John 3 : 9	Flowers_0001_41	bgc-0008
1-John-3-10	In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.	1-John 3 : 10	Flowers_0001_42	bgc-0009
1-John-3-11	For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.	1-John 3 : 11	Flowers_0001_43	bgc-0010
1-John-3-12	Not as Cain, <i>who</i> was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brotherâ€™s righteous.	1-John 3 : 12	Flowers_0001_44	bgc-0011
1-John-3-13	Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.	1-John 3 : 13	Flowers_0001_45	bgc-0012
1-John-3-14	We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not <i>his</i> brother abideth in death.	1-John 3 : 14	Flowers_0001_46	bgc-0013
1-John-3-15	Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.	1-John 3 : 15	Flowers_0001_47	bgc-0014
1-John-3-16	Hereby perceive we the love <i>of God</i>, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down <i>our</i> lives for the brethren.	1-John 3 : 16	Flowers_0001_48	bgc-0015
1-John-3-17	But whoso hath this worldâ€™s good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels <i>of compassion</i> from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?	1-John 3 : 17	Flowers_0001_49	bgc-0016
1-John-3-18	My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.	1-John 3 : 18	Flowers_0001_50	bgc-0003
1-John-3-19	And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.	1-John 3 : 19	Flowers_0001_51	bgc-0004
1-John-3-20	For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.	1-John 3 : 20	Flowers_0001_52	bgc-0005
1-John-3-21	Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, <i>then</i> have we confidence toward God.	1-John 3 : 21	Flowers_0001_53	bgc-0006
1-John-3-22	And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.	1-John 3 : 22	Flowers_0001_54	bgc-0007
1-John-3-23	And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.	1-John 3 : 23	Flowers_0001_55	bgc-0008
1-John-3-24	And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.	1-John 3 : 24	Flowers_0001_56	bgc-0009
1-John-4-1	Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.	1-John 4 : 1	Flowers_0001_57	bgc-0010
1-John-4-2	Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:	1-John 4 : 2	Flowers_0001_58	bgc-0011
1-John-4-3	And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that <i>spirit</i> of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.	1-John 4 : 3	Flowers_0001_59	bgc-0012
1-John-4-4	Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.	1-John 4 : 4	Flowers_0001_60	bgc-0013
1-John-4-5	They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.	1-John 4 : 5	Flowers_0001_61	bgc-0014
1-John-4-6	We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.	1-John 4 : 6	Flowers_0001_62	bgc-0015
1-John-4-7	Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.	1-John 4 : 7	Flowers_0001_63	bgc-0016
1-John-4-8	He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.	1-John 4 : 8	Flowers_0001_64	bgc-0003
1-John-4-9	In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.	1-John 4 : 9	Flowers_0001_65	bgc-0004
1-John-4-10	Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son <i>to be</i> the propitiation for our sins.	1-John 4 : 10	Flowers_0001_66	bgc-0005
1-John-4-11	Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.	1-John 4 : 11	Flowers_0001_67	bgc-0006
1-John-4-12	No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.	1-John 4 : 12	Flowers_0001_68	bgc-0007
1-John-4-13	Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.	1-John 4 : 13	Flowers_0001_69	bgc-0008
1-John-4-14	And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son <i>to be</i> the Saviour of the world.	1-John 4 : 14	Flowers_0001_70	bgc-0009
1-John-4-15	Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.	1-John 4 : 15	Flowers_0001_71	bgc-0010
1-John-4-16	And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.	1-John 4 : 16	Flowers_0001_72	bgc-0011
1-John-4-17	Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.	1-John 4 : 17	Flowers_0001_73	bgc-0012
1-John-4-18	There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.	1-John 4 : 18	Flowers_0001_74	bgc-0013
1-John-4-19	We love him, because he first loved us.	1-John 4 : 19	Flowers_0001_75	bgc-0014
1-John-4-20	If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?	1-John 4 : 20	Flowers_0001_76	bgc-0015
1-John-4-21	And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.	1-John 4 : 21	Flowers_0001_77	bgc-0016
1-John-5-1	Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.	1-John 5 : 1	Flowers_0001_78	bgc-0003
1-John-5-2	By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God, and keep his commandments.	1-John 5 : 2	Flowers_0001_79	bgc-0004
1-John-5-3	For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not grievous.	1-John 5 : 3	Flowers_0001_80	bgc-0005
1-John-5-4	For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, <i>even</i> our faith.	1-John 5 : 4	Flowers_0001_81	bgc-0006
1-John-5-5	Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?	1-John 5 : 5	Flowers_0001_82	bgc-0007
1-John-5-6	This is he that came by water and blood, <i>even</i> Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.	1-John 5 : 6	Flowers_0001_83	bgc-0008
1-John-5-7	For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.	1-John 5 : 7	Flowers_0001_84	bgc-0009
1-John-5-8	And there are three that bear witness in earth, the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.	1-John 5 : 8	Flowers_0001_85	bgc-0010
1-John-5-9	If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his Son.	1-John 5 : 9	Flowers_0001_86	bgc-0011
1-John-5-10	He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.	1-John 5 : 10	Flowers_0001_87	bgc-0012
1-John-5-11	And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.	1-John 5 : 11	Flowers_0001_88	bgc-0013
1-John-5-12	He that hath the Son hath life; <i>and</i> he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.	1-John 5 : 12	Flowers_0001_89	bgc-0014
1-John-5-13	These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.	1-John 5 : 13	Flowers_0001_90	bgc-0015
1-John-5-14	And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:	1-John 5 : 14	Flowers_0001_91	bgc-0016
1-John-5-15	And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him.	1-John 5 : 15	Flowers_0001_92	bgc-0003
1-John-5-16	If any man see his brother sin a sin <i>which is</i> not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it.	1-John 5 : 16	Flowers_0001_93	bgc-0004
1-John-5-17	All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.	1-John 5 : 17	Flowers_0001_94	bgc-0005
1-John-5-18	We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not.	1-John 5 : 18	Flowers_0001_95	bgc-0006
1-John-5-19	<i>And</i> we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in wickedness.	1-John 5 : 19	Flowers_0001_96	bgc-0007
1-John-5-20	And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, <i>even</i> in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God, and eternal life.	1-John 5 : 20	Flowers_0001_97	bgc-0008
1-John-5-21	Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.	1-John 5 : 21	Flowers_0001_98	bgc-0009
2-John-1-1	The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;	2-John 1 : 1	Flowers_0001_99	bgc-0010
2-John-1-2	For the truthâ€™s sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.	2-John 1 : 2	Flowers_0001_100	bgc-0011
2-John-1-3	Grace be with you, mercy, <i>and</i> peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.	2-John 1 : 3	Flowers_0001_101	bgc-0012
2-John-1-4	I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.	2-John 1 : 4	Flowers_0001_102	bgc-0013
2-John-1-5	And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.	2-John 1 : 5	Flowers_0001_103	bgc-0014
2-John-1-6	And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.	2-John 1 : 6	Flowers_0001_104	bgc-0015
2-John-1-7	For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.	2-John 1 : 7	Flowers_0001_105	bgc-0016
2-John-1-8	Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.	2-John 1 : 8	Flowers_0001_106	bgc-0003
2-John-1-9	Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.	2-John 1 : 9	Flowers_0001_107	bgc-0004
2-John-1-10	If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into <i>your</i> house, neither bid him God speed:	2-John 1 : 10	Flowers_0001_108	bgc-0005
2-John-1-11	For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.	2-John 1 : 11	Flowers_0001_109	bgc-0006
2-John-1-12	Having many things to write unto you, I would not <i>write</i> with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.	2-John 1 : 12	Flowers_0001_110	bgc-0007
2-John-1-13	The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.	2-John 1 : 13	Flowers_0001_111	bgc-0008
3-John-1-1	The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.	3-John 1 : 1	Flowers_0001_112	bgc-0009
3-John-1-2	Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.	3-John 1 : 2	Flowers_0001_113	bgc-0010
3-John-1-3	For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.	3-John 1 : 3	Flowers_0001_114	bgc-0011
3-John-1-4	I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.	3-John 1 : 4	Flowers_0001_115	bgc-0012
3-John-1-5	Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;	3-John 1 : 5	Flowers_0001_116	bgc-0013
3-John-1-6	Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:	3-John 1 : 6	Flowers_0001_117	bgc-0014
3-John-1-7	Because that for his nameâ€™s sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.	3-John 1 : 7	Flowers_0001_118	bgc-0015
3-John-1-8	We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.	3-John 1 : 8	Flowers_0001_119	bgc-0016
3-John-1-9	I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.	3-John 1 : 9	Flowers_0001_120	bgc-0003
3-John-1-10	Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth <i>them</i> out of the church.	3-John 1 : 10	Flowers_0001_121	bgc-0004
3-John-1-11	Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.	3-John 1 : 11	Flowers_0001_122	bgc-0005
3-John-1-12	Demetrius hath good report of all <i>men</i>, and of the truth itself: yea, and we <i>also</i> bear record; and ye know that our record is true.	3-John 1 : 12	Flowers_0001_123	bgc-0006
3-John-1-13	I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:	3-John 1 : 13	Flowers_0001_124	bgc-0007
3-John-1-14	But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace <i>be</i> to thee. <i>Our</i> friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.	3-John 1 : 14	Flowers_0001_125	bgc-0008
Jude-1-1	Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ, <i>and</i> called:	Jude 1 : 1	Flowers_0001_126	bgc-0009
Jude-1-2	Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.	Jude 1 : 2	Flowers_0001_127	bgc-0010
Jude-1-3	Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and exhort <i>you</i> that ye should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints.	Jude 1 : 3	Flowers_0001_128	bgc-0011
Jude-1-4	For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.	Jude 1 : 4	Flowers_0001_129	bgc-0012
Jude-1-5	I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.	Jude 1 : 5	Flowers_0001_130	bgc-0013
Jude-1-6	And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.	Jude 1 : 6	Flowers_0001_131	bgc-0014
Jude-1-7	Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.	Jude 1 : 7	Flowers_0001_132	bgc-0015
Jude-1-8	Likewise also these <i>filthy</i> dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.	Jude 1 : 8	Flowers_0001_133	bgc-0016
Jude-1-9	Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.	Jude 1 : 9	Flowers_0001_134	bgc-0003
Jude-1-10	But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves.	Jude 1 : 10	Flowers_0001_135	bgc-0004
Jude-1-11	Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in the gainsaying of Core.	Jude 1 : 11	Flowers_0001_136	bgc-0005
Jude-1-12	These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds <i>they are</i> without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;	Jude 1 : 12	Flowers_0001_137	bgc-0006
Jude-1-13	Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame; wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness for ever.	Jude 1 : 13	Flowers_0001_138	bgc-0007
Jude-1-14	And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints,	Jude 1 : 14	Flowers_0001_139	bgc-0008
Jude-1-15	To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard <i>speeches</i> which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.	Jude 1 : 15	Flowers_0001_140	bgc-0009
Jude-1-16	These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling <i>words</i>, having menâ€™s persons in admiration because of advantage.	Jude 1 : 16	Flowers_0001_141	bgc-0010
Jude-1-17	But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;	Jude 1 : 17	Flowers_0001_142	bgc-0011
Jude-1-18	How that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.	Jude 1 : 18	Flowers_0001_143	bgc-0012
Jude-1-19	These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the Spirit.	Jude 1 : 19	Flowers_0001_144	bgc-0013
Jude-1-20	But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,	Jude 1 : 20	Flowers_0001_145	bgc-0014
Jude-1-21	Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.	Jude 1 : 21	Flowers_0001_146	bgc-0015
Jude-1-22	And of some have compassion, making a difference:	Jude 1 : 22	Flowers_0001_147	bgc-0016
Jude-1-23	And others save with fear, pulling <i>them</i> out of the fire; hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.	Jude 1 : 23	Flowers_0001_148	bgc-0003
Jude-1-24	Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to present <i>you</i> faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,	Jude 1 : 24	Flowers_0001_149	bgc-0004
Jude-1-25	To the only wise God our Saviour, <i>be</i> glory and majesty, dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.	Jude 1 : 25	Flowers_0001_150	bgc-0005
Revelation-1-1	The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass; and he sent and signified <i>it</i> by his angel unto his servant John:	Revelation 1 : 1	Flowers_0001_151	bgc-0006

Revelation-1-4	John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace <i>be</i> unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne;	Revelation 1 : 4	Flowers_0001_154	bgc-0009
Revelation-1-5	And from Jesus Christ, <i>who is</i> the faithful witness, <i>and</i> the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood,	Revelation 1 : 5	Flowers_0001_155	bgc-0010
Revelation-1-6	And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him <i>be</i> glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.	Revelation 1 : 6	Flowers_0001_156	bgc-0011
Revelation-1-7	Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they <i>also</i> which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.	Revelation 1 : 7	Flowers_0001_157	bgc-0012
Revelation-1-8	I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty.	Revelation 1 : 8	Flowers_0001_158	bgc-0013
Revelation-1-9	I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.	Revelation 1 : 9	Flowers_0001_159	bgc-0014
Revelation-1-10	I was in the Spirit on the Lordâ€™s day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,	Revelation 1 : 10	Flowers_0001_160	bgc-0015
Revelation-1-11	Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send <i>it</i> unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.	Revelation 1 : 11	Flowers_0001_161	bgc-0016
Revelation-1-12	And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;	Revelation 1 : 12	Flowers_0001_162	bgc-0003
Revelation-1-13	And in the midst of the seven candlesticks <i>one</i> like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle.	Revelation 1 : 13	Flowers_0001_163	bgc-0004
Revelation-1-14	His head and <i>his</i> hairs <i>were</i> white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes <i>were</i> as a flame of fire;	Revelation 1 : 14	Flowers_0001_164	bgc-0005
Revelation-1-15	And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.	Revelation 1 : 15	Flowers_0001_165	bgc-0006
Revelation-1-16	And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance <i>was</i> as the sun shineth in his strength.	Revelation 1 : 16	Flowers_0001_166	bgc-0007
Revelation-1-17	And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last:	Revelation 1 : 17	Flowers_0001_167	bgc-0008
Revelation-1-18	<i>I am</i> he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.	Revelation 1 : 18	Flowers_0001_168	bgc-0009
Revelation-1-19	Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter;	Revelation 1 : 19	Flowers_0001_169	bgc-0010
Revelation-1-20	The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches.	Revelation 1 : 20	Flowers_0001_170	bgc-0011
Revelation-2-1	Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;	Revelation 2 : 1	Flowers_0001_171	bgc-0012
Revelation-2-2	I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:	Revelation 2 : 2	Flowers_0001_172	bgc-0013
Revelation-2-3	And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my nameâ€™s sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.	Revelation 2 : 3	Flowers_0001_173	bgc-0014
Revelation-2-4	Nevertheless I have <i>somewhat</i> against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.	Revelation 2 : 4	Flowers_0001_174	bgc-0015
Revelation-2-5	Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.	Revelation 2 : 5	Flowers_0001_175	bgc-0016

Revelation 2 : 13	Flowers_0001_183	bgc-0010
Revelation-2-14	But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.	Revelation 2 : 14	Flowers_0001_184	bgc-0011

Revelation-3-4	Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they are worthy.	Revelation 3 : 4	Flowers_0001_203	bgc-0016

Revelation-3-15	I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot.	Revelation 3 : 15	Flowers_0001_214	bgc-0013
Revelation-3-16	So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.	Revelation 3 : 16	Flowers_0001_215	bgc-0014
Revelation-3-17	Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:	Revelation 3 : 17	Flowers_0001_216	bgc-0015
Revelation-3-18	I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and <i>that</i> the shame of thy nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.

Revelation-4-1	After this I looked, and, behold, a door <i>was</i> opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard <i>was</i> as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter.	Revelation 4 : 1	Flowers_0001_222	bgc-0007
Revelation-4-2	And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and <i>one</i> sat on the throne.	Revelation 4 : 2	Flowers_0001_223	bgc-0008
Revelation-4-3	And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and <i>there was</i> a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.	Revelation 4 : 3	Flowers_0001_224	bgc-0009
Revelation-4-4	And round about the throne <i>were</i> four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.	Revelation 4 : 4	Flowers_0001_225	bgc-0010
Revelation-4-5	And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and <i>there were</i> seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.	Revelation 4 : 5	Flowers_0001_226	bgc-0011
Revelation-4-6	And before the throne <i>there was</i> a sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, <i>were</i> four beasts full of eyes before and behind.	Revelation 4 : 6	Flowers_0001_227	bgc-0012
Revelation-4-7	And the first beast <i>was</i> like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast <i>was</i> like a flying eagle.	Revelation 4 : 7	Flowers_0001_228	bgc-0013
Revelation-4-8	And the four beasts had each of them six wings about <i>him</i>; and <i>they were</i> full of eyes within: and they rest not day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.	Revelation 4 : 8	Flowers_0001_229	bgc-0014
Revelation-4-9	And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,	Revelation 4 : 9	Flowers_0001_230	bgc-0015
Revelation-4-10	The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,	Revelation 4 : 10	Flowers_0001_231	bgc-0016
Revelation-4-11	Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.	Revelation 4 : 11	Flowers_0001_232	bgc-0003
Revelation-5-1	And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.	Revelation 5 : 1	Flowers_0001_233	bgc-0004
Revelation-5-2	And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?	Revelation 5 : 2	Flowers_0001_234	bgc-0005
Revelation-5-3	And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.	Revelation 5 : 3	Flowers_0001_235	bgc-0006
Revelation-5-4	And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.	Revelation 5 : 4	Flowers_0001_236	bgc-0007
Revelation-5-5	And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.	Revelation 5 : 5	Flowers_0001_237	bgc-0008
Revelation-5-6	And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.	Revelation 5 : 6	Flowers_0001_238	bgc-0009
Revelation-5-7	And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.	Revelation 5 : 7	Flowers_0001_239	bgc-0010
Revelation-5-8	And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four <i>and</i> twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of saints.	Revelation 5 : 8	Flowers_0001_240	bgc-0011
Revelation-5-9	And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;	Revelation 5 : 9	Flowers_0001_241	bgc-0012
Revelation-5-10	And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.	Revelation 5 : 10	Flowers_0001_242	bgc-0013
Revelation-5-11	And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;	Revelation 5 : 11	Flowers_0001_243	bgc-0014
Revelation-5-12	Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing.	Revelation 5 : 12	Flowers_0001_244	bgc-0015
Revelation-5-13	And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, <i>be</i> unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.	Revelation 5 : 13	Flowers_0001_245	bgc-0016
Revelation-5-14	And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four <i>and</i> twenty elders fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.	Revelation 5 : 14	Flowers_0001_246	bgc-0003
Revelation-6-1	And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.	Revelation 6 : 1	Flowers_0001_247	bgc-0004
Revelation-6-2	And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.	Revelation 6 : 2	Flowers_0001_248	bgc-0005
Revelation-6-3	And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, Come and see.	Revelation 6 : 3	Flowers_0001_249	bgc-0006
Revelation-6-4	And there went out another horse <i>that was</i> red: and <i>power</i> was given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another: and there was given unto him a great sword.	Revelation 6 : 4	Flowers_0001_250	bgc-0007
Revelation-6-5	And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.	Revelation 6 : 5	Flowers_0001_251	bgc-0008
Revelation-6-6	And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny; and <i>see</i> thou hurt not the oil and the wine.	Revelation 6 : 6	Flowers_0001_252	bgc-0009
Revelation-6-7	And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see.	Revelation 6 : 7	Flowers_0001_253	bgc-0010
Revelation-6-8	And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth.	Revelation 6 : 8	Flowers_0001_254	bgc-0011
Revelation-6-9	And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held:	Revelation 6 : 9	Flowers_0001_255	bgc-0012
Revelation-6-10	And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?	Revelation 6 : 10	Flowers_0001_256	bgc-0013
Revelation-6-11	And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season, until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that should be killed as they <i>were</i>, should be fulfilled.	Revelation 6 : 11	Flowers_0001_257	bgc-0014
Revelation-6-12	And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;	Revelation 6 : 12	Flowers_0001_258	bgc-0015
Revelation-6-13	And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.	Revelation 6 : 13	Flowers_0001_259	bgc-0016
Revelation-6-14	And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.	Revelation 6 : 14	Flowers_0001_260	bgc-0003
Revelation-6-15	And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of the mountains;	Revelation 6 : 15	Flowers_0001_261	bgc-0004
Revelation-6-16	And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb:	Revelation 6 : 16	Flowers_0001_262	bgc-0005
Revelation-6-17	For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able to stand?	Revelation 6 : 17	Flowers_0001_263	bgc-0006
Revelation-7-1	And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.	Revelation 7 : 1	Flowers_0001_264	bgc-0007
Revelation-7-2	And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea,	Revelation 7 : 2	Flowers_0001_265	bgc-0008
Revelation-7-3	Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads.	Revelation 7 : 3	Flowers_0001_266	bgc-0009
Revelation-7-4	And I heard the number of them which were sealed: <i>and there were</i> sealed an hundred <i>and</i> forty <i>and</i> four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel.	Revelation 7 : 4	Flowers_0001_267	bgc-0010

Revelation-7-9	After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;	Revelation 7 : 9	Flowers_0001_272	bgc-0015
Revelation-7-10	And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.	Revelation 7 : 10	Flowers_0001_273	bgc-0016
Revelation-7-11	And all the angels stood round about the throne, and <i>about</i> the elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God,	Revelation 7 : 11	Flowers_0001_274	bgc-0003
Revelation-7-12	Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, <i>be</i> unto our God for ever and ever. Amen.	Revelation 7 : 12	Flowers_0001_275	bgc-0004
Revelation-7-13	And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?	Revelation 7 : 13	Flowers_0001_276	bgc-0005
Revelation-7-14	And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.	Revelation 7 : 14	Flowers_0001_277	bgc-0006
Revelation-7-15	Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them.	Revelation 7 : 15	Flowers_0001_278	bgc-0007
Revelation-7-16	They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat.	Revelation 7 : 16	Flowers_0001_279	bgc-0008
Revelation-7-17	For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.	Revelation 7 : 17	Flowers_0001_280	bgc-0009
Revelation-8-1	And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.	Revelation 8 : 1	Flowers_0001_281	bgc-0010
Revelation-8-2	And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets.	Revelation 8 : 2	Flowers_0001_282	bgc-0011
Revelation-8-3	And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer <i>it</i> with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne.	Revelation 8 : 3	Flowers_0001_283	bgc-0012
Revelation-8-4	And the smoke of the incense, <i>which came</i> with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angelâ€™s hand.	Revelation 8 : 4	Flowers_0001_284	bgc-0013
Revelation-8-5	And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast <i>it</i> into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.	Revelation 8 : 5	Flowers_0001_285	bgc-0014

Revelation-8-10	And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;	Revelation 8 : 10	Flowers_0001_290	bgc-0005
Revelation-8-11	And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter.	Revelation 8 : 11	Flowers_0001_291	bgc-0006
Revelation-8-12	And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise.	Revelation 8 : 12	Flowers_0001_292	bgc-0007
Revelation-8-13	And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!	Revelation 8 : 13	Flowers_0001_293	bgc-0008
Revelation-9-1	And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.	Revelation 9 : 1	Flowers_0001_294	bgc-0009
Revelation-9-2	And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.	Revelation 9 : 2	Flowers_0001_295	bgc-0010
Revelation-9-3	And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.	Revelation 9 : 3	Flowers_0001_296	bgc-0011
Revelation-9-4	And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads.	Revelation 9 : 4	Flowers_0001_297	bgc-0012
Revelation-9-5	And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment <i>was</i> as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.	Revelation 9 : 5	Flowers_0001_298	bgc-0013
Revelation-9-6	And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.	Revelation 9 : 6	Flowers_0001_299	bgc-0014
Revelation-9-7	And the shapes of the locusts <i>were</i> like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads <i>were</i> as it were crowns like gold, and their faces <i>were</i> as the faces of men.	Revelation 9 : 7	Flowers_0001_300	bgc-0015
Revelation-9-8	And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as <i>the teeth</i> of lions.	Revelation 9 : 8	Flowers_0001_301	bgc-0016
Revelation-9-9	And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings <i>was</i> as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.	Revelation 9 : 9	Flowers_0001_302	bgc-0003
Revelation-9-10	And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power <i>was</i> to hurt men five months.	Revelation 9 : 10	Flowers_0001_303	bgc-0004
Revelation-9-11	And they had a king over them, <i>which is</i> the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue <i>is</i> Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath <i>his</i> name Apollyon.	Revelation 9 : 11	Flowers_0001_304	bgc-0005

Revelation-9-13	And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,	Revelation 9 : 13	Flowers_0001_306	bgc-0007
Revelation-9-14	Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates.	Revelation 9 : 14	Flowers_0001_307	bgc-0008
Revelation-9-15	And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men.	Revelation 9 : 15	Flowers_0001_308	bgc-0009
Revelation-9-16	And the number of the army of the horsemen <i>were</i> two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them.	Revelation 9 : 16	Flowers_0001_309	bgc-0010
Revelation-9-17	And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses <i>were</i> as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.	Revelation 9 : 17	Flowers_0001_310	bgc-0011
Revelation-9-18	By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.	Revelation 9 : 18	Flowers_0001_311	bgc-0012
Revelation-9-19	For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails <i>were</i> like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt.	Revelation 9 : 19	Flowers_0001_312	bgc-0013
Revelation-9-20	And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:	Revelation 9 : 20	Flowers_0001_313	bgc-0014
Revelation-9-21	Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.	Revelation 9 : 21	Flowers_0001_314	bgc-0015
Revelation-10-1	And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow <i>was</i> upon his head, and his face <i>was</i> as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:	Revelation 10 : 1	Flowers_0001_315	bgc-0016
Revelation-10-2	And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and <i>his</i> left <i>foot</i> on the earth,	Revelation 10 : 2	Flowers_0001_316	bgc-0003
Revelation-10-3	And cried with a loud voice, as <i>when</i> a lion roareth: and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.	Revelation 10 : 3	Flowers_0001_317	bgc-0004
Revelation-10-4	And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not.	Revelation 10 : 4	Flowers_0001_318	bgc-0005
Revelation-10-5	And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven,	Revelation 10 : 5	Flowers_0001_319	bgc-0006

Revelation-10-9	And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take <i>it</i>, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.	Revelation 10 : 9	Flowers_0001_323	bgc-0010
Revelation-10-10	And I took the little book out of the angelâ€™s hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.	Revelation 10 : 10	Flowers_0001_324	bgc-0011

Revelation-11-3	And I will give <i>power</i> unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred <i>and</i> threescore days, clothed in sackcloth.	Revelation 11 : 3	Flowers_0001_328	bgc-0015
Revelation-11-4	These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.	Revelation 11 : 4	Flowers_0001_329	bgc-0016
Revelation-11-5	And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.	Revelation 11 : 5	Flowers_0001_330	bgc-0003

Revelation-14-14	And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud <i>one</i> sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.	Revelation 14 : 14	Flowers_0001_50	bgc-0010

Revelation-14-20	And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand <i>and</i> six hundred furlongs.	Revelation 14 : 20	Flowers_0001_56	bgc-0016
Revelation-15-1	And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.	Revelation 15 : 1	Flowers_0001_57	bgc-0003
Revelation-15-2	And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, <i>and</i> over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.	Revelation 15 : 2	Flowers_0001_58	bgc-0004
Revelation-15-3	And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous <i>are</i> thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true <i>are</i> thy ways, thou King of saints.	Revelation 15 : 3	Flowers_0001_59	bgc-0005

Revelation-16-1	And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.	Revelation 16 : 1	Flowers_0001_65	bgc-0011
Revelation-16-2	And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and <i>upon</i> them which worshipped his image.	Revelation 16 : 2	Flowers_0001_66	bgc-0012
Revelation-16-3	And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead <i>man</i>: and every living soul died in the sea.	Revelation 16 : 3	Flowers_0001_67	bgc-0013

Revelation-16-5	And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus.	Revelation 16 : 5	Flowers_0001_69	bgc-0015
Revelation-16-6	For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.	Revelation 16 : 6	Flowers_0001_70	bgc-0016

Revelation-16-13	And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs <i>come</i> out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.	Revelation 16 : 13	Flowers_0001_77	bgc-0009
Revelation-16-14	For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, <i>which</i> go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.	Revelation 16 : 14	Flowers_0001_78	bgc-0010
Revelation-16-15	Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed <i>is</i> he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.	Revelation 16 : 15	Flowers_0001_79	bgc-0011

Revelation-16-17	And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done.	Revelation 16 : 17	Flowers_0001_81	bgc-0013
Revelation-16-18	And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, <i>and</i> so great.	Revelation 16 : 18	Flowers_0001_82	bgc-0014
Revelation-16-19	And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.	Revelation 16 : 19	Flowers_0001_83	bgc-0015

Revelation-16-21	And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, <i>every stone</i> about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.	Revelation 16 : 21	Flowers_0001_85	bgc-0003
Revelation-17-1	And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters:	Revelation 17 : 1	Flowers_0001_86	bgc-0004
Revelation-17-2	With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.	Revelation 17 : 2	Flowers_0001_87	bgc-0005
Revelation-17-3	So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.	Revelation 17 : 3	Flowers_0001_88	bgc-0006
Revelation-17-4	And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:	Revelation 17 : 4	Flowers_0001_89	bgc-0007
Revelation-17-5	And upon her forehead <i>was</i> a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.	Revelation 17 : 5	Flowers_0001_90	bgc-0008
Revelation-17-6	And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.	Revelation 17 : 6	Flowers_0001_91	bgc-0009
Revelation-17-7	And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.	Revelation 17 : 7	Flowers_0001_92	bgc-0010
Revelation-17-8	The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.	Revelation 17 : 8	Flowers_0001_93	bgc-0011
Revelation-17-9	And here <i>is</i> the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.	Revelation 17 : 9	Flowers_0001_94	bgc-0012
Revelation-17-10	And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, <i>and</i> the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must continue a short space.	Revelation 17 : 10	Flowers_0001_95	bgc-0013
Revelation-17-11	And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.	Revelation 17 : 11	Flowers_0001_96	bgc-0014
Revelation-17-12	And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.	Revelation 17 : 12	Flowers_0001_97	bgc-0015
Revelation-17-13	These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength unto the beast.	Revelation 17 : 13	Flowers_0001_98	bgc-0016
Revelation-17-14	These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him <i>are</i> called, and chosen, and faithful.	Revelation 17 : 14	Flowers_0001_99	bgc-0003
Revelation-17-15	And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.	Revelation 17 : 15	Flowers_0001_100	bgc-0004
Revelation-17-16	And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.	Revelation 17 : 16	Flowers_0001_101	bgc-0005
Revelation-17-17	For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.	Revelation 17 : 17	Flowers_0001_102	bgc-0006
Revelation-17-18	And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which reigneth over the kings of the earth.	Revelation 17 : 18	Flowers_0001_103	bgc-0007
Revelation-18-1	And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory.	Revelation 18 : 1	Flowers_0001_104	bgc-0008
Revelation-18-2	And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.	Revelation 18 : 2	Flowers_0001_105	bgc-0009
Revelation-18-3	For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of her delicacies.	Revelation 18 : 3	Flowers_0001_106	bgc-0010
Revelation-18-4	And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.	Revelation 18 : 4	Flowers_0001_107	bgc-0011
Revelation-18-5	For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.	Revelation 18 : 5	Flowers_0001_108	bgc-0012
Revelation-18-6	Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.	Revelation 18 : 6	Flowers_0001_109	bgc-0013
Revelation-18-7	How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.	Revelation 18 : 7	Flowers_0001_110	bgc-0014
Revelation-18-8	Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong <i>is</i> the Lord God who judgeth her.	Revelation 18 : 8	Flowers_0001_111	bgc-0015
Revelation-18-9	And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,	Revelation 18 : 9	Flowers_0001_112	bgc-0016
Revelation-18-10	Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one hour is thy judgment come.	Revelation 18 : 10	Flowers_0001_113	bgc-0003
Revelation-18-11	And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:	Revelation 18 : 11	Flowers_0001_114	bgc-0004
Revelation-18-12	The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and marble,	Revelation 18 : 12	Flowers_0001_115	bgc-0005
Revelation-18-13	And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.	Revelation 18 : 13	Flowers_0001_116	bgc-0006
Revelation-18-14	And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.	Revelation 18 : 14	Flowers_0001_117	bgc-0007
Revelation-18-15	The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,	Revelation 18 : 15	Flowers_0001_118	bgc-0008
Revelation-18-16	And saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and precious stones, and pearls!	Revelation 18 : 16	Flowers_0001_119	bgc-0009
Revelation-18-17	For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as many as trade by sea, stood afar off,	Revelation 18 : 17	Flowers_0001_120	bgc-0010
Revelation-18-18	And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What <i>city is</i> like unto this great city!	Revelation 18 : 18	Flowers_0001_121	bgc-0011
Revelation-18-19	And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.	Revelation 18 : 19	Flowers_0001_122	bgc-0012
Revelation-18-20	Rejoice over her, <i>thou</i> heaven, and <i>ye</i> holy apostles and prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.	Revelation 18 : 20	Flowers_0001_123	bgc-0013
Revelation-18-21	And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast <i>it</i> into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.	Revelation 18 : 21	Flowers_0001_124	bgc-0014
Revelation-18-22	And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatsoever craft <i>he be</i>, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;	Revelation 18 : 22	Flowers_0001_125	bgc-0015
Revelation-18-23	And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations deceived.	Revelation 18 : 23	Flowers_0001_126	bgc-0016
Revelation-18-24	And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth.	Revelation 18 : 24	Flowers_0001_127	bgc-0003
Revelation-19-1	And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour, and power, unto the Lord our God:	Revelation 19 : 1	Flowers_0001_128	bgc-0004
Revelation-19-2	For true and righteous <i>are</i> his judgments: for he hath judged the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her hand.	Revelation 19 : 2	Flowers_0001_129	bgc-0005
Revelation-19-3	And again they said, Alleluia. And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.	Revelation 19 : 3	Flowers_0001_130	bgc-0006

Revelation-19-6	And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth.	Revelation 19 : 6	Flowers_0001_133	bgc-0009
Revelation-19-7	Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself ready.	Revelation 19 : 7	Flowers_0001_134	bgc-0010
Revelation-19-8	And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the righteousness of saints.	Revelation 19 : 8	Flowers_0001_135	bgc-0011
Revelation-19-9	And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed <i>are</i> they which are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me, These are the true sayings of God.	Revelation 19 : 9	Flowers_0001_136	bgc-0012
Revelation-19-10	And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See <i>thou do it</i> not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.	Revelation 19 : 10	Flowers_0001_137	bgc-0013
Revelation-19-11	And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him <i>was</i> called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war.	Revelation 19 : 11	Flowers_0001_138	bgc-0014
Revelation-19-12	His eyes <i>were</i> as a flame of fire, and on his head <i>were</i> many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.	Revelation 19 : 12	Flowers_0001_139	bgc-0015
Revelation-19-13	And he <i>was</i> clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God.	Revelation 19 : 13	Flowers_0001_140	bgc-0016
Revelation-19-14	And the armies <i>which were</i> in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.	Revelation 19 : 14	Flowers_0001_141	bgc-0003
Revelation-19-15	And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.	Revelation 19 : 15	Flowers_0001_142	bgc-0004
Revelation-19-16	And he hath on <i>his</i> vesture and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.	Revelation 19 : 16	Flowers_0001_143	bgc-0005

Revelation-19-18	That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all <i>men, both</i> free and bond, both small and great.	Revelation 19 : 18	Flowers_0001_145	bgc-0007
Revelation-19-19	And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.	Revelation 19 : 19	Flowers_0001_146	bgc-0008
Revelation-19-20	And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone.	Revelation 19 : 20	Flowers_0001_147	bgc-0009
Revelation-19-21	And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which <i>sword</i> proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.	Revelation 19 : 21	Flowers_0001_148	bgc-0010

Revelation-20-3	And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season.	Revelation 20 : 3	Flowers_0001_151	bgc-0013
Revelation-20-4	And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and <i>I saw</i> the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received <i>his</i> mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.	Revelation 20 : 4	Flowers_0001_152	bgc-0014
Revelation-20-5	But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This <i>is</i> the first resurrection.	Revelation 20 : 5	Flowers_0001_153	bgc-0015
