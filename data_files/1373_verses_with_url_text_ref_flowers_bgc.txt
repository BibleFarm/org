1-Chronicles-16-11	Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.	1-Chronicles 16 : 11	Flowers_0001_1	bgc-0003
1-Chronicles-16-8	Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people.	1-Chronicles 16 : 8	Flowers_0001_2	bgc-0004
1-Chronicles-17-11	And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go <i>to be</i> with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.	1-Chronicles 17 : 11	Flowers_0001_3	bgc-0005
1-Chronicles-22-13	Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.	1-Chronicles 22 : 13	Flowers_0001_4	bgc-0006
1-Chronicles-29-11	Thine, O LORD, <i>is</i> the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all <i>that is</i> in the heaven and in the earth <i>is thine</i>; thine <i>is</i> the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all.	1-Chronicles 29 : 11	Flowers_0001_5	bgc-0007
1-Chronicles-29-12	Both riches and honour <i>come</i> of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand <i>is</i> power and might; and in thine hand <i>it is</i> to make great, and to give strength unto all.	1-Chronicles 29 : 12	Flowers_0001_6	bgc-0008
1-Chronicles-29-13	Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.	1-Chronicles 29 : 13	Flowers_0001_7	bgc-0009
1-Chronicles-29-14	But who <i>am</i> I, and what <i>is</i> my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things <i>come</i> of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.	1-Chronicles 29 : 14	Flowers_0001_8	bgc-0010
1-Chronicles-29-15	For we <i>are</i> strangers before thee, and sojourners, as <i>were</i> all our fathers: our days on the earth <i>are</i> as a shadow, and <i>there is</i> none abiding.	1-Chronicles 29 : 15	Flowers_0001_9	bgc-0011
1-Chronicles-29-17	I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.	1-Chronicles 29 : 17	Flowers_0001_10	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-1-10	Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and <i>that</i> there be no divisions among you; but <i>that</i> ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.	1-Corinthians 1 : 10	Flowers_0001_11	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-1-18	For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.	1-Corinthians 1 : 18	Flowers_0001_12	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-1-25	Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.	1-Corinthians 1 : 25	Flowers_0001_13	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-1-30	But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:	1-Corinthians 1 : 30	Flowers_0001_14	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-1-9	God <i>is</i> faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.	1-Corinthians 1 : 9	Flowers_0001_15	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-10-13	There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God <i>is</i> faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear <i>it</i>.	1-Corinthians 10 : 13	Flowers_0001_16	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-10-31	Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.	1-Corinthians 10 : 31	Flowers_0001_17	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-11-12	For as the woman <i>is</i> of the man, even so <i>is</i> the man also by the woman; but all things of God.	1-Corinthians 11 : 12	Flowers_0001_18	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-12-12	For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also <i>is</i> Christ.	1-Corinthians 12 : 12	Flowers_0001_19	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-12-13	For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether <i>we be</i> Jews or Gentiles, whether <i>we be</i> bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.	1-Corinthians 12 : 13	Flowers_0001_20	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-12-4	Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.	1-Corinthians 12 : 4	Flowers_0001_21	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-13-11	When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.	1-Corinthians 13 : 11	Flowers_0001_22	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-13-13	And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these <i>is</i> charity.	1-Corinthians 13 : 13	Flowers_0001_23	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-13-4	Charity suffereth long, <i>and</i> is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,	1-Corinthians 13 : 4	Flowers_0001_24	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-13-8	Charity never faileth: but whether <i>there be</i> prophecies, they shall fail; whether <i>there be</i> tongues, they shall cease; whether <i>there be</i> knowledge, it shall vanish away.	1-Corinthians 13 : 8	Flowers_0001_25	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-14-1	Follow after charity, and desire spiritual <i>gifts</i>, but rather that ye may prophesy.	1-Corinthians 14 : 1	Flowers_0001_26	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-14-33	For God is not <i>the author</i> of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.	1-Corinthians 14 : 33	Flowers_0001_27	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-15-3	For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;	1-Corinthians 15 : 3	Flowers_0001_28	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-15-4	And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:	1-Corinthians 15 : 4	Flowers_0001_29	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-15-45	And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam <i>was made</i> a quickening spirit.	1-Corinthians 15 : 45	Flowers_0001_30	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-15-50	Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.	1-Corinthians 15 : 50	Flowers_0001_31	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-15-51	Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,	1-Corinthians 15 : 51	Flowers_0001_32	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-15-55	O death, where <i>is</i> thy sting? O grave, where <i>is</i> thy victory?	1-Corinthians 15 : 55	Flowers_0001_33	bgc-0007
1-Corinthians-15-57	But thanks <i>be</i> to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.	1-Corinthians 15 : 57	Flowers_0001_34	bgc-0008
1-Corinthians-15-58	Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.	1-Corinthians 15 : 58	Flowers_0001_35	bgc-0009
1-Corinthians-16-13	Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.	1-Corinthians 16 : 13	Flowers_0001_36	bgc-0010
1-Corinthians-2-14	But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know <i>them</i>, because they are spiritually discerned.	1-Corinthians 2 : 14	Flowers_0001_37	bgc-0011
1-Corinthians-2-16	For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.	1-Corinthians 2 : 16	Flowers_0001_38	bgc-0012
1-Corinthians-2-9	But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.	1-Corinthians 2 : 9	Flowers_0001_39	bgc-0013
1-Corinthians-3-11	For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.	1-Corinthians 3 : 11	Flowers_0001_40	bgc-0014
1-Corinthians-3-16	Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and <i>that</i> the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?	1-Corinthians 3 : 16	Flowers_0001_41	bgc-0015
1-Corinthians-3-3	For ye are yet carnal: for whereas <i>there is</i> among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?	1-Corinthians 3 : 3	Flowers_0001_42	bgc-0016
1-Corinthians-3-9	For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry, <i>ye are</i> God’s building.	1-Corinthians 3 : 9	Flowers_0001_43	bgc-0003
1-Corinthians-4-6	And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and <i>to</i> Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think <i>of men</i> above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.	1-Corinthians 4 : 6	Flowers_0001_44	bgc-0004
1-Corinthians-6-19	What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost <i>which is</i> in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?	1-Corinthians 6 : 19	Flowers_0001_45	bgc-0005
1-Corinthians-6-20	For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s.	1-Corinthians 6 : 20	Flowers_0001_46	bgc-0006
1-Corinthians-8-6	But to us <i>there is but</i> one God, the Father, of whom <i>are</i> all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom <i>are</i> all things, and we by him.	1-Corinthians 8 : 6	Flowers_0001_47	bgc-0007
1-John-1-1	That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;	1-John 1 : 1	Flowers_0001_48	bgc-0008
1-John-1-2	(For the life was manifested, and we have seen <i>it</i>, and bear witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested unto us;)	1-John 1 : 2	Flowers_0001_49	bgc-0009
1-John-1-5	This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.	1-John 1 : 5	Flowers_0001_50	bgc-0010
1-John-1-7	But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.	1-John 1 : 7	Flowers_0001_51	bgc-0011
1-John-1-8	If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.	1-John 1 : 8	Flowers_0001_52	bgc-0012
1-John-1-9	If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us <i>our</i> sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.	1-John 1 : 9	Flowers_0001_53	bgc-0013
1-John-2-1	My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous:	1-John 2 : 1	Flowers_0001_54	bgc-0014
1-John-2-15	Love not the world, neither the things <i>that are</i> in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.	1-John 2 : 15	Flowers_0001_55	bgc-0015
1-John-2-18	Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.	1-John 2 : 18	Flowers_0001_56	bgc-0016
1-John-2-2	And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for <i>the sins of</i> the whole world.	1-John 2 : 2	Flowers_0001_57	bgc-0003
1-John-2-29	If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that doeth righteousness is born of him.	1-John 2 : 29	Flowers_0001_58	bgc-0004
1-John-2-3	And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments.	1-John 2 : 3	Flowers_0001_59	bgc-0005
1-John-3-1	Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.	1-John 3 : 1	Flowers_0001_60	bgc-0006
1-John-3-11	For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.	1-John 3 : 11	Flowers_0001_61	bgc-0007
1-John-3-16	Hereby perceive we the love <i>of God</i>, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down <i>our</i> lives for the brethren.	1-John 3 : 16	Flowers_0001_62	bgc-0008
1-John-3-2	Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.	1-John 3 : 2	Flowers_0001_63	bgc-0009
1-John-3-20	For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.	1-John 3 : 20	Flowers_0001_64	bgc-0010
1-John-3-21	Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, <i>then</i> have we confidence toward God.	1-John 3 : 21	Flowers_0001_65	bgc-0011
1-John-3-22	And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.	1-John 3 : 22	Flowers_0001_66	bgc-0012
1-John-3-23	And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.	1-John 3 : 23	Flowers_0001_67	bgc-0013
1-John-3-24	And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.	1-John 3 : 24	Flowers_0001_68	bgc-0014
1-John-3-4	Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.	1-John 3 : 4	Flowers_0001_69	bgc-0015
1-John-3-8	He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.	1-John 3 : 8	Flowers_0001_70	bgc-0016
1-John-4-1	Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.	1-John 4 : 1	Flowers_0001_71	bgc-0003
1-John-4-10	Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son <i>to be</i> the propitiation for our sins.	1-John 4 : 10	Flowers_0001_72	bgc-0004
1-John-4-11	Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.	1-John 4 : 11	Flowers_0001_73	bgc-0005
1-John-4-12	No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.	1-John 4 : 12	Flowers_0001_74	bgc-0006
1-John-4-15	Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.	1-John 4 : 15	Flowers_0001_75	bgc-0007
1-John-4-16	And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.	1-John 4 : 16	Flowers_0001_76	bgc-0008
1-John-4-18	There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.	1-John 4 : 18	Flowers_0001_77	bgc-0009
1-John-4-19	We love him, because he first loved us.	1-John 4 : 19	Flowers_0001_78	bgc-0010
1-John-4-4	Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.	1-John 4 : 4	Flowers_0001_79	bgc-0011
1-John-4-5	They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.	1-John 4 : 5	Flowers_0001_80	bgc-0012
1-John-4-7	Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.	1-John 4 : 7	Flowers_0001_81	bgc-0013
1-John-4-8	He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.	1-John 4 : 8	Flowers_0001_82	bgc-0014
1-John-5-1	Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him.	1-John 5 : 1	Flowers_0001_83	bgc-0015
1-John-5-11	And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.	1-John 5 : 11	Flowers_0001_84	bgc-0016
1-John-5-12	He that hath the Son hath life; <i>and</i> he that hath not the Son of God hath not life.	1-John 5 : 12	Flowers_0001_85	bgc-0003
1-John-5-13	These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.	1-John 5 : 13	Flowers_0001_86	bgc-0004
1-John-5-14	And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:	1-John 5 : 14	Flowers_0001_87	bgc-0005
1-John-5-4	For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, <i>even</i> our faith.	1-John 5 : 4	Flowers_0001_88	bgc-0006
1-John-5-5	Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?	1-John 5 : 5	Flowers_0001_89	bgc-0007
1-John-5-7	For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.	1-John 5 : 7	Flowers_0001_90	bgc-0008
1-Kings-2-3	And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest thyself:	1-Kings 2 : 3	Flowers_0001_91	bgc-0009
1-Kings-8-23	And he said, LORD God of Israel, <i>there is</i> no God like thee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant and mercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart:	1-Kings 8 : 23	Flowers_0001_92	bgc-0010
1-Kings-8-39	Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do, and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest; (for thou, <i>even</i> thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children of men;)	1-Kings 8 : 39	Flowers_0001_93	bgc-0011
1-Peter-1-13	Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;	1-Peter 1 : 13	Flowers_0001_94	bgc-0012
1-Peter-1-16	Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.	1-Peter 1 : 16	Flowers_0001_95	bgc-0013
1-Peter-1-2	Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and peace, be multiplied.	1-Peter 1 : 2	Flowers_0001_96	bgc-0014
1-Peter-1-23	Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.	1-Peter 1 : 23	Flowers_0001_97	bgc-0015
1-Peter-1-3	Blessed <i>be</i> the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,	1-Peter 1 : 3	Flowers_0001_98	bgc-0016
1-Peter-1-9	Receiving the end of your faith, <i>even</i> the salvation of <i>your</i> souls.	1-Peter 1 : 9	Flowers_0001_99	bgc-0003
1-Peter-2-21	For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps:	1-Peter 2 : 21	Flowers_0001_100	bgc-0004
1-Peter-2-24	Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed.	1-Peter 2 : 24	Flowers_0001_101	bgc-0005
1-Peter-2-3	If so be ye have tasted that the Lord <i>is</i> gracious.	1-Peter 2 : 3	Flowers_0001_102	bgc-0006
1-Peter-2-4	To whom coming, <i>as unto</i> a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, <i>and</i> precious,	1-Peter 2 : 4	Flowers_0001_103	bgc-0007
1-Peter-2-9	But ye <i>are</i> a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:	1-Peter 2 : 9	Flowers_0001_104	bgc-0008
1-Peter-3-15	But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and <i>be</i> ready always to <i>give</i> an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:	1-Peter 3 : 15	Flowers_0001_105	bgc-0009
1-Peter-3-18	For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:	1-Peter 3 : 18	Flowers_0001_106	bgc-0010
1-Peter-3-21	The like figure whereunto <i>even</i> baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:	1-Peter 3 : 21	Flowers_0001_107	bgc-0011
1-Peter-3-22	Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.	1-Peter 3 : 22	Flowers_0001_108	bgc-0012
1-Peter-3-9	Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.	1-Peter 3 : 9	Flowers_0001_109	bgc-0013

1-Peter-5-7	Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.	1-Peter 5 : 7	Flowers_0001_115	bgc-0005
1-Peter-5-8	Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:	1-Peter 5 : 8	Flowers_0001_116	bgc-0006

1-Samuel-15-22	And Samuel said, Hath the LORD <i>as great</i> delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey <i>is</i> better than sacrifice, <i>and</i> to hearken than the fat of rams.	1-Samuel 15 : 22	Flowers_0001_118	bgc-0008
1-Samuel-16-7	But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for <i>the LORD seeth</i> not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.	1-Samuel 16 : 7	Flowers_0001_119	bgc-0009

1-Thessalonians-4-16	For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:	1-Thessalonians 4 : 16	Flowers_0001_129	bgc-0005

1-Thessalonians-5-9	For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,	1-Thessalonians 5 : 9	Flowers_0001_137	bgc-0013
1-Timothy-1-15	This <i>is</i> a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.	1-Timothy 1 : 15	Flowers_0001_138	bgc-0014
1-Timothy-1-17	Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, <i>be</i> honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.	1-Timothy 1 : 17	Flowers_0001_139	bgc-0015
1-Timothy-2-1	I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, <i>and</i> giving of thanks, be made for all men;	1-Timothy 2 : 1	Flowers_0001_140	bgc-0016
1-Timothy-2-5	For <i>there is</i> one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;	1-Timothy 2 : 5	Flowers_0001_141	bgc-0003
1-Timothy-3-16	And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.	1-Timothy 3 : 16	Flowers_0001_142	bgc-0004
1-Timothy-3-5	(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)	1-Timothy 3 : 5	Flowers_0001_143	bgc-0005
1-Timothy-4-1	Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;	1-Timothy 4 : 1	Flowers_0001_144	bgc-0006
1-Timothy-4-12	Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.	1-Timothy 4 : 12	Flowers_0001_145	bgc-0007

1-Timothy-6-11	But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.	1-Timothy 6 : 11	Flowers_0001_148	bgc-0010
1-Timothy-6-12	Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.	1-Timothy 6 : 12	Flowers_0001_149	bgc-0011
1-Timothy-6-6	But godliness with contentment is great gain.	1-Timothy 6 : 6	Flowers_0001_150	bgc-0012
1-Timothy-6-7	For we brought nothing into <i>this</i> world, <i>and it is</i> certain we can carry nothing out.	1-Timothy 6 : 7	Flowers_0001_151	bgc-0013
1-Timothy-6-8	And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.	1-Timothy 6 : 8	Flowers_0001_152	bgc-0014
1-Timothy-6-9	But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and <i>into</i> many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.	1-Timothy 6 : 9	Flowers_0001_153	bgc-0015
2-Chronicles-15-7	Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for your work shall be rewarded.	2-Chronicles 15 : 7	Flowers_0001_154	bgc-0016
2-Chronicles-7-14	If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.	2-Chronicles 7 : 14	Flowers_0001_155	bgc-0003
2-Corinthians-10-5	Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;	2-Corinthians 10 : 5	Flowers_0001_156	bgc-0004
2-Corinthians-12-9	And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.	2-Corinthians 12 : 9	Flowers_0001_157	bgc-0005
2-Corinthians-13-11	Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.	2-Corinthians 13 : 11	Flowers_0001_158	bgc-0006
2-Corinthians-2-14	Now thanks <i>be</i> unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.	2-Corinthians 2 : 14	Flowers_0001_159	bgc-0007
2-Corinthians-2-17	For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.	2-Corinthians 2 : 17	Flowers_0001_160	bgc-0008
2-Corinthians-3-18	But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, <i>even</i> as by the Spirit of the Lord.	2-Corinthians 3 : 18	Flowers_0001_161	bgc-0009
2-Corinthians-4-17	For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding <i>and</i> eternal weight of glory;	2-Corinthians 4 : 17	Flowers_0001_162	bgc-0010
2-Corinthians-4-18	While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen <i>are</i> temporal; but the things which are not seen <i>are</i> eternal.	2-Corinthians 4 : 18	Flowers_0001_163	bgc-0011
2-Corinthians-4-4	In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them.	2-Corinthians 4 : 4	Flowers_0001_164	bgc-0012
2-Corinthians-4-6	For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to <i>give</i> the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.	2-Corinthians 4 : 6	Flowers_0001_165	bgc-0013
2-Corinthians-5-10	For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things <i>done</i> in <i>his</i> body, according to that he hath done, whether <i>it be</i> good or bad.	2-Corinthians 5 : 10	Flowers_0001_166	bgc-0014
2-Corinthians-5-17	Therefore if any man <i>be</i> in Christ, <i>he is</i> a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.	2-Corinthians 5 : 17	Flowers_0001_167	bgc-0015
2-Corinthians-5-21	For he hath made him <i>to be</i> sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.	2-Corinthians 5 : 21	Flowers_0001_168	bgc-0016
2-Corinthians-5-7	(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)	2-Corinthians 5 : 7	Flowers_0001_169	bgc-0003
2-Corinthians-6-14	Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?	2-Corinthians 6 : 14	Flowers_0001_170	bgc-0004
2-Corinthians-6-16	And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in <i>them</i>; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.	2-Corinthians 6 : 16	Flowers_0001_171	bgc-0005
2-Corinthians-8-9	For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.	2-Corinthians 8 : 9	Flowers_0001_172	bgc-0006
2-Corinthians-9-10	Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for <i>your</i> food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;	2-Corinthians 9 : 10	Flowers_0001_173	bgc-0007
2-Corinthians-9-7	Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, <i>so let him give</i>; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.	2-Corinthians 9 : 7	Flowers_0001_174	bgc-0008
2-John-1-10	If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into <i>your</i> house, neither bid him God speed:	2-John 1 : 10	Flowers_0001_175	bgc-0009
2-John-1-2	For the truth’s sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.	2-John 1 : 2	Flowers_0001_176	bgc-0010
2-John-1-5	And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.	2-John 1 : 5	Flowers_0001_177	bgc-0011
2-John-1-6	And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.	2-John 1 : 6	Flowers_0001_178	bgc-0012
2-John-1-8	Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.	2-John 1 : 8	Flowers_0001_179	bgc-0013
2-Peter-1-11	For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.	2-Peter 1 : 11	Flowers_0001_180	bgc-0014
2-Peter-1-19	We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:	2-Peter 1 : 19	Flowers_0001_181	bgc-0015
2-Peter-1-2	Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,	2-Peter 1 : 2	Flowers_0001_182	bgc-0016
2-Peter-1-20	Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.	2-Peter 1 : 20	Flowers_0001_183	bgc-0003
2-Peter-1-21	For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake <i>as they were</i> moved by the Holy Ghost.	2-Peter 1 : 21	Flowers_0001_184	bgc-0004
2-Peter-1-3	According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that <i>pertain</i> unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:	2-Peter 1 : 3	Flowers_0001_185	bgc-0005
2-Peter-1-4	Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.	2-Peter 1 : 4	Flowers_0001_186	bgc-0006
2-Peter-1-5	And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;	2-Peter 1 : 5	Flowers_0001_187	bgc-0007
2-Peter-2-1	But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.	2-Peter 2 : 1	Flowers_0001_188	bgc-0008
2-Peter-3-10	But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.	2-Peter 3 : 10	Flowers_0001_189	bgc-0009
2-Peter-3-17	Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know <i>these things</i> before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.	2-Peter 3 : 17	Flowers_0001_190	bgc-0010
2-Peter-3-18	But grow in grace, and <i>in</i> the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him <i>be</i> glory both now and for ever. Amen.	2-Peter 3 : 18	Flowers_0001_191	bgc-0011
2-Peter-3-8	But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day <i>is</i> with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.	2-Peter 3 : 8	Flowers_0001_192	bgc-0012
2-Peter-3-9	The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.	2-Peter 3 : 9	Flowers_0001_193	bgc-0013
2-Samuel-22-33	God <i>is</i> my strength <i>and</i> power: and he maketh my way perfect.	2-Samuel 22 : 33	Flowers_0001_194	bgc-0014
2-Samuel-23-3	The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men <i>must be</i> just, ruling in the fear of God.	2-Samuel 23 : 3	Flowers_0001_195	bgc-0015
2-Samuel-7-22	Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for <i>there is</i> none like thee, neither <i>is there any</i> God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.	2-Samuel 7 : 22	Flowers_0001_196	bgc-0016
2-Thessalonians-1-11	Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of <i>this</i> calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of <i>his</i> goodness, and the work of faith with power:	2-Thessalonians 1 : 11	Flowers_0001_197	bgc-0003
2-Thessalonians-1-12	That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.	2-Thessalonians 1 : 12	Flowers_0001_198	bgc-0004
2-Thessalonians-2-13	But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:	2-Thessalonians 2 : 13	Flowers_0001_199	bgc-0005
2-Thessalonians-2-15	Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.	2-Thessalonians 2 : 15	Flowers_0001_200	bgc-0006
2-Thessalonians-2-3	Let no man deceive you by any means: for <i>that day shall not come</i>, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;	2-Thessalonians 2 : 3	Flowers_0001_201	bgc-0007
2-Thessalonians-3-10	For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.	2-Thessalonians 3 : 10	Flowers_0001_202	bgc-0008
2-Thessalonians-3-13	But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.	2-Thessalonians 3 : 13	Flowers_0001_203	bgc-0009
2-Thessalonians-3-16	Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord <i>be</i> with you all.	2-Thessalonians 3 : 16	Flowers_0001_204	bgc-0010
2-Thessalonians-3-3	But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep <i>you</i> from evil.	2-Thessalonians 3 : 3	Flowers_0001_205	bgc-0011
2-Timothy-1-12	For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.	2-Timothy 1 : 12	Flowers_0001_206	bgc-0012
2-Timothy-1-13	Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.	2-Timothy 1 : 13	Flowers_0001_207	bgc-0013
2-Timothy-1-14	That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.	2-Timothy 1 : 14	Flowers_0001_208	bgc-0014
2-Timothy-1-7	For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.	2-Timothy 1 : 7	Flowers_0001_209	bgc-0015
2-Timothy-2-1	Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.	2-Timothy 2 : 1	Flowers_0001_210	bgc-0016
2-Timothy-2-15	Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.	2-Timothy 2 : 15	Flowers_0001_211	bgc-0003
2-Timothy-2-19	Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.	2-Timothy 2 : 19	Flowers_0001_212	bgc-0004
2-Timothy-2-21	If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master’s use, <i>and</i> prepared unto every good work.	2-Timothy 2 : 21	Flowers_0001_213	bgc-0005
2-Timothy-2-22	Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.	2-Timothy 2 : 22	Flowers_0001_214	bgc-0006
2-Timothy-2-23	But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.	2-Timothy 2 : 23	Flowers_0001_215	bgc-0007
2-Timothy-2-24	And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all <i>men</i>, apt to teach, patient,	2-Timothy 2 : 24	Flowers_0001_216	bgc-0008
2-Timothy-2-25	In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;	2-Timothy 2 : 25	Flowers_0001_217	bgc-0009
2-Timothy-2-3	Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.	2-Timothy 2 : 3	Flowers_0001_218	bgc-0010
